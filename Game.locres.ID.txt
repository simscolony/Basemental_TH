It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

66_Text=Ah, it’s always so much fun seeing the youngsters racing around and having fun.//<portrait=normal>Make sure you have fun too, <PlayerName>$player</>.
104_Text=Ah, now this is the beach I remember.//Thank you for helping with the cleanup, <PlayerName>$player</>.
186_Text=Ah, the famed <PlayerName>$player</>. Great to finally meet you. I'm <NPCName>Walter</>.
166_Text=Ah, yes, yes, you're the new farmer! My name is <NPCName>Ling</>, I run the research lab here.
141_Text=Ah, you're that new farmer that moved here last season! It's good to meet you.//I'm <NPCName>Anne</>. My husband, my daughter and I moved here so we can film the wildlife on the island.
159_Text=Ah, you're that player that moved in last Spring! I'm <NPCName>Kenny</>, it's nice to finally meet you.//I work with my dad at the ranch right next to you!
85_Text=Are you going to join us, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>?//<portrait=happy>I bet I can pick up more trash than you!
171_Text=Are you ready to participate in the annual trash collecting race? I sure am!
2_Text=Are you ready to start the race?
25_Text=At least <NPCName>Archie</> and <NPCName>Surya</> are here.
103_Text=Better luck next time!
124_Text=Better luck next year, <PlayerName>$player</>.
56_Text=Can we just get the trash picking going already?
78_Text=Can you take a picture of me over there?
72_Text=Chatting helps pass the time. Before I know it, I’ve filled up lots of bags!
144_Text=Come, please enjoy yourself at the festival.
102_Text=Congrats on winning, <PlayerName>$player</>.//You swam so fast!
115_Text=Congratulations are in order! Amazing speed there!
123_Text=Congratulations, <PlayerName>$player</>.//How does it feel to win? What prize did you get?
99_Text=Dad said picking up trash is good. Even though it’s not our trash.
96_Text=Days like these are why we chose to move out here. The sun is just beaming, isn’t it?
181_Text=Do you like fishing player? You must stop by and purchase a fishing rod.
22_Text=Don’t forget to be extra careful about the sun, <PlayerName>$player</>.//People get nasty sunburns at the beach.
23_Text=Don’t forget to drink water too!//<portrait=annoyed>Dehydration isn’t fun.
34_Text=Don’t listen to what <NPCName>Bree</> says. I’m just here to collect trash and help keep the beach clean.//Not win the race.
68_Text=Don’t strain yourself if you plan on joining the swimming race, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Just have fun with it.
92_Text=GOOD, SON!
130_Text=HA HA! THERE’S MY SWIMMING BUDDY.//COLD COCONUT WATER ON ME, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
177_Text=Have you seen my daughter, <NPCName>Zoe</>? She's about this high, short wavy hair, orange scarf around her neck?
100_Text=Having a relaxing day?
188_Text=Hello there, stranger. We finally meet.//<portrait=normal>My name is <NPCName>Yuri</>, I'm one of the physicians here.
190_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>, I'm <NPCName>Zoe</>.//I'm trying to catch some crabs, but I think the people keep scaring them.
185_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>, My name is <NPCName>Valentina</>. I live at the Inn with my mom and my Aunt Alice. My mom can't be here, though, so <NPCName>Aunt Alice</> and I are going ourselves.
44_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>. Archie and I are competing to build the best sandcastle.
1_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>! Welcome to the Beach Cleanup Festival!//It’s such a nice day for cleaning up the beach, isn’t it?//Will you be joining in the race? Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll gather everybody here.
139_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>, I've heard so much about you! My name is <NPCName>Alice</>.
182_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>, it's nice to meet you. I'm the same like you, I just moved here, too!//This festival is nice, isn't it? We didn't have anything like this back home.
154_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>, nice to meet you!//My name is <NPCName>Eva</> and I have a little corner in <NPCName>Sam</>'s store where I sell my baked goods.
49_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>. Are you ready for the festival?//<portrait=happy>My students have been talking about it nonstop!
178_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>. I'm <NPCName>Rafael</>. Nice to meet you.//Um, I guess I should tell you that I'm one of the blacksmiths in town. My brother is the other one, <NPCName>Pablo</>.
168_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>. Pleasure to meet you. My name is <NPCName>Luke</>.//I run Socket and Pan in town. Head on over if you ever want to upgrade the appliances in your farm or the like.
32_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>! Good to see you here! I love the beach cleanup festival and look forward to it every single year.
29_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>! What do you think of the festival so far?//<portrait=normal>Don’t worry, the fun will start soon!
57_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>, are you going to be in the race?// <NPCName>Charles</> and I are on medic duty, but it looks like he’s got it covered. I’m going to enjoy the beach a little bit.
169_Text=Hey, good to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. I'm <NPCName>Macy</>.//<portrait=normal>I'm a photographer, as you can probably tell by this camera here.//How are you enjoying the island so far?
109_Text=Hey, look at the champion! Good job, there, <PlayerName>$player</>.
170_Text=Hi <PlayerName>$player</>, nice to meet you! I'm <NPCName>Noah</>.//I work at the tavern right over there with my brother <NPCName>Frank</>.
172_Text=Hi, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>. My name is <NPCName>Oliver</>.//I live with my dad right over there!
51_Text=Hi, <PlayerName>$player</>. We’re here for the beach cleanup.
64_Text=Hmm, it seems counterintuitive for Pufferfish Corp to be distributing those flyers, doesn’t it?//Shouldn’t we be decreasing the trash, not adding to it?
90_Text=Honestly, I think I’m a bit too old for it.//<portrait=happy>But they always get so excited when I join them.
42_Text=Hopefully, we can influence more people by showing how much fun it is to do good.
74_Text=I can hear <NPCName>Sunny</> talking all the way from here.
140_Text=I can't believe this is the first time we've met.//<portrait=normal>How do you find the town so far?
163_Text=I can't imagine why you'd want to change your life so drastically by moving here, Player, but I hope things are going well for you.
173_Text=I can't wait for the race to start. Even <NPCName>Mr. Barnes</> is joining us!
95_Text=I can’t wait to grow up so I can join the swimming contest.
52_Text=I can’t wait to swim afterward.
106_Text=I didn’t have to do anything today, which is especially nice when you’re a medical professional.//Not a single person got heatstroke!
192_Text=I don't like to stay in town for very long, but I do like to come back for the beach festival.//<portrait=happy>It's one of my favorite things ever.
60_Text=I don’t really know why we have to hold a festival just to clean up the beach.//People love parties, I guess.
121_Text=I got some really great photos, <PlayerName>$player</>!//Can’t wait to edit them.
27_Text=I just love festivals. There are so many people around!//It’s even better when they’re on the beach.
187_Text=I know exactly how you feel <PlayerName>$player</>. I was also working a corporate job in the city.//<portrait=happy>But the small town life is so much nicer, right? I mean look at this festival!
21_Text=I like to just swim slowly, at my own pace.
81_Text=I lost count of how much water I drank.//<portrait=normal>Good thing the Beach Shack’s nearby.
30_Text=I love the cleanup festival. The beach is so clean afterward. It should be like that every day!
41_Text=I need to hunt for the best spot to take photos of the cleanup.//<portrait=happy>I don’t want to miss a single thing.
80_Text=I remember the first beach festival I attended was more about the town coming together and celebrating Summer one last time.
135_Text=I saw you running out there, <PlayerName>$player</>. So fast!//No wonder you won the race.
193_Text=I see. You're the new farmer. My name is <NPCName>Jim</>.
79_Text=I think it’s working, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m not getting a sunburn.//<portrait=happy>THANK YOU, <NPCName>CHARLES</>!
87_Text=I think my daughter said she saw a dolphin nearby.//Maybe they’re curious and wanted to see why so many humans were gathering.
125_Text=I think the yelling and the bullhorn scared those dolphins away.
24_Text=I told <NPCName>Joko</> to take a break and come here since it’s such a nice day!//<portrait=normal>Well, I’m going to enjoy the festival with or without him.
18_Text=I was just chatting with <NPCName>Ling</> about the beach I remember from when I was a child.
97_Text=I was just telling my buddy <NPCName>Randy</> here about how we can sell tickets to these events. Make money from it, hmm?
58_Text=I wonder if I’ll get to see any cool animals today.//Dad said there are too many people, so there might not be any.
200_Text=I won’t lose again this year!//<portrait=sad>But then again, <NPCName>Sunny’s</> entering again, so…
167_Text=I'm so glad you bought that farm instead of Pufferfish. I mean just look at them.//<portrait=annoyed>Who do they think they are?!
84_Text=If you're feeling dizzy, please stop and see one of the doctors right away.
174_Text=Is this... the farmer I've been hearing so much about? I can't believe I get to finally meet you!//My name is <NPCName>Pablo</>, I run the blacksmith shop with my brother <NPCName>Rafael</>.
122_Text=It felt really good to clean the beach.// Back in the day, my dad used to bust out and buy us ice creams after we were done cleaning the beach.
156_Text=It's not too far from here. Why don't you stop on by?//<portrait=concerned>Oh but not today, though, it's closed for the festival.
47_Text=It’s a bit loud, isn’t it?//So many people…
105_Text=It’s been such a nice day.//Time to get back to normal life.
14_Text=It’s good to see you, <PlayerName>$player</>.//It’s a nice day for beach cleaning, isn’t it?
70_Text=It’s great that we’re gathering today to clean up the beach.//<portrait=concerned>But I wonder if it’s enough…
26_Text=It’s nice to be out and about. Are you looking forward to the festival, <PlayerName>$player</>?
55_Text=It’s nice to go to the beach every now and then, isn’t it?//The cleanup festival is one of the few times we all gather and just have fun.
38_Text=It’s nice to see so many people out here.//It means lots of people care about the ocean as much as I do.
93_Text=It’s so hot today. Gotta keep hydrated!
98_Text=It’s so nice out. I don’t wanna go home!
197_Text=It’s that time of the year, <PlayerName>$player</>. I can’t wait to compete again. Heh heh.
69_Text=It’s the perfect weather for swimming.
40_Text=It’s very hot today, <PlayerName>$player</>. Make sure you stay hydrated.//I sure am.
59_Text=I’ll keep looking anyway!
83_Text=I’m excited to take some great photos today.//<portrait=happy>The light looks great, and I don’t see a single cloud in the sky.
94_Text=I’m glad the town is working together to clean the beach.//<portrait=sad>Do you know how much trash I gather just from fishing?//Too much, <PlayerName>$player</>, too much…
54_Text=I’m helping <NPCName>Archie</> build his sandcastle.//Then we’re going to clean up the beach later!
61_Text=I’m so glad <NPCName>Macy</> is here.//Pics or it didn’t happen, right?
31_Text=I’ve got my shovel, and I’m ready to clean up this beach.//Where’s yours, <PlayerName>$player</>?
131_Text=JIM!!!//LET’S FIRE UP THE GRILL FOR <PlayerName>$PLAYER</> HERE!
120_Text=Job well done, <PlayerName>$player</>. Looks like the beach will stay clean for the time being.
86_Text=Just doing some stretching here, <PlayerName>$player</>.
76_Text=Let’s forget about Pufferfish for now.//I’m ready to pick up some trash.
137_Text=Looks like everyone is starting to leave.//I should be able to catch more fish this way.
89_Text=My students love the cleaning race.//They basically forced me to take part!
158_Text=My wife, <NPCName>Kira</>, and I live by the edge of the forest, not too far away from the Ranch.//And my boy, too, <NPCName>Kenny</>. He helps out at the ranch.
180_Text=Nice to finally meet you. I'm <NPCName>Sunny</> and I live with my son, <NPCName>Oliver</>, at the Beach Shack behind us.
142_Text=Nice to meet you <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>, My name is <NPCName>Archie</>!//Are you here to race with us?
155_Text=Nice to meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>! I can't believe you haven't stopped by the tavern yet!//My name is <NPCName>Frank</>. The Fishensip is where I work.
149_Text=Nice to meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. My name is <NPCName>Dinda</>.//I live at the carpenter's house with my husband <NPCName>Joko</> and my son <NPCName>Archie</>.
176_Text=Nice to meet you, too, <PlayerName>$player</>. I'm <NPCName>npc name</>Paul.//My wife, <NPCName>Anne</> is over there by the Pufferfush booth. She and I film the wildlife in the area.
128_Text=Nice work, <PlayerName>$player</>.//My brother’s surprisingly good at this game, but I’m sure you can beat him next time.
146_Text=Not too far from your farm, actually. I'm sure you've passed by it. 
143_Text=Oh hello dear! My name is <NPCName>Betty</>.//It's good to finally put a face to the farmer I've been hearing about.
71_Text=Oh yeah, the swimming race...contest, whatever.//I used to participate a few years ago, but now I just like to chat with people while we’re picking up trash.
183_Text=Oh, I live with my aunt and uncle for now and I work with <NPCName>Ling</> at the research lab.//That's why I moved here, actually.
150_Text=Oh, and also with my nephew here, <NPCName>Surya</>. He just moved in like you.//It's his first beach cleanup festival, too!
108_Text=Oh, it’s so nice to see everyone had a good time.
67_Text=Oh, look at that. Looks like <NPCName>Kira</> is all fired up.
191_Text=Oh, so <Italic>you're</> the farmer that moved to that old farm. Intreresting.//My name is <NPCName>Nina</>. I come and go from the island so this is probably why we haven't met yet.
36_Text=People just love that feel-good community action stuff.
129_Text=Phew! I’m not young anymore!//Time to hit the hay.
148_Text=Please enjoy yourself at the beach festival, but don't forget to watch your physical health, especially in this heat.//Two words to remember: water and sunscreen.
162_Text=Pleasure to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. My name is <NPCName>Leah</>.//I teach yoga on the weekends. Stop by the community center if you want to join us.
43_Text=Ready to clean the beach, <PlayerName>$player</>?//If we all work together, we can pick up all the trash in no time.
175_Text=Ready to collect some trash, <PlayerName>$player</>? It's one of my favorite things about the festival!
75_Text=Shoveling trash might not be the most glamorous thing, but it’s much better than shoveling manure, trust me.
62_Text=Since our inn is right by the beach, it’s important to me that it’s kept clean.//<portrait=happy>That’s why I always take part in the cleanup.
45_Text=So happy you can join us! Will you look at all the people here?//<portrait=normal>It’s so nice to see the town getting together like this. And for a good cause too.
145_Text=So you're the one that moved to that empty farm. Why did it take us so long to meet?//My name is <NPCName>Bree</>. I live at Hillside Brewery and Vineyard with my husband <NPCName>Walter</> and my son <NPCName>Luke</>.
189_Text=So, you've been living here for around two seasons.//Do you like this town? It's a charming place, isn't it?
46_Text=Some of the animals hide when there are so many people on the beach.//Poor things.
110_Text=Sorry you didn’t win, <PlayerName>$player</>. You gave it your best.
4_Text=Still want to mingle, <PlayerName>$player</>? No rush. The beach festival is first and foremost about community, after all.//Just come back when you’re ready to start.
118_Text=Success! I didn’t get a sunburn.//I feel tired, though.
37_Text=Sunscreen, sunscreen…//Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>, got your sunscreen on?//I sure have. Don’t want a repeat of the Cherry Blossom festival…
196_Text=Tch. Afraid of getting wet or something?//<portrait=normal>Well, you know where to find me if you want to participate.
39_Text=That Pufferfish booth, though… I don’t like them being here.// They can pretend they love to keep the ocean clean as much as they want, but we both know the truth.
136_Text=That was some effort you put in out there, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Too bad you didn’t win. Maybe next time.
132_Text=That was very fun, <PlayerName>$player</>!//I can’t wait to do it again next year.
3_Text=That’s great!//I’ll call everyone over, and we’ll begin shortly.
195_Text=That’s the spirit. Go warm up first. I’ll call the others over.
35_Text=The beach cleanup festival is the perfect time to get some pictures.
184_Text=The farmer has arrived. Yes, I've heard about you. My name is <NPCName>Theo</>, I'm a fisherman/musician.//Please, enjoy the beach as much as you can!
82_Text=The other good thing about this festival is we’re nearing the end of Summer.//I’m ready for Fall.
161_Text=The trash collection is about to start soon. Are you prepared, <PlayerName>$player</>?
19_Text=There weren’t as many people as there are now.//Maybe that’s why the beach was cleaner then.
88_Text=This is fun.//Are you having fun, <PlayerName>$player</>?
198_Text=Ugh. This’ll be the year I beat that old man in the race…
48_Text=Ugh…
15_Text=Unfortunately, <NPCName>Suki</> can’t join us today.//It’s her turn to mind the inn.//Someone’s gotta do it, y’know?
138_Text=We did good today, doll.//Loving the community spirit.
179_Text=Well good to meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. I was wondering when I was going to see the person that moved into that old farm.//Is this your first festival? Please have fun, my students certainly are!
147_Text=Well good to meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>.//My name is <NPCName>Charles</> and I'm one of the physicians here in town.
157_Text=Well now, I finally meet the new farmer that moved in!//<portrait=normal>My name is <NPCName>Jack</>, I take care of the animals at the ranch right by your farm.
199_Text=Well, I’m only entering the race for fun.//<portrait=happy>Everyone already knows who’s gonna win it anyway!
160_Text=Well, well, well, the farmer finally shows their face. My name is <NPCName>Kira</>. 
33_Text=What I don’t look forward to is whatever Pufferfish is planning.//This is the first time they’ve had a booth here, and I don’t like it.
126_Text=What a day, huh, friend?
112_Text=What a good day, <PlayerName>$player</>. Guess it’s back to the daily grind tomorrow!
165_Text=What do I do? Oh, I'm a cybersecurity specialist so there's really no need for me to leave the house.//<portrait=happy>But it is nice to go to the festival every now and then.
117_Text=Why, yes, <PlayerName>$player</>, I did get some good pictures for social media.//You’re in a couple of them, actually. Wanna see?
20_Text=Will you be entering the swimming contest?//I’m not a very competitive person myself.//Unlike <NPCName>Chaem</> here.
63_Text=Will you be joining the race, <PlayerName>$player</>?//At the very least, it should be fun.
134_Text=Would you look at these folks cleaning the beach!//What a sight… What a sight!
127_Text=Wow, congratulations, <PlayerName>$player</>!//I saw how fast you were running there.
111_Text=Wow, look at all the trash we gathered!//On the one hand, it’s very impressive for us.//<portrait=sad>But on the other hand, it’s sad there was even this much trash to begin with…
119_Text=Wow, look at all this trash…//It’s good we got it out of the ocean.
116_Text=You did well. You should enter the swimming contest again next year!
113_Text=You know what? This shovel really came in handy!
101_Text=You look good! That outfit really suits you.
77_Text=You might not think so, but collecting trash can be hard physical work.//Gotta make sure I warm up properly, or I might pull something.//<portrait=annoyed>I’m not as spry as I used to be, unfortunately.
151_Text=You must be that new farmer <NPCName>Mayor Connor</> mentioned. My name is <NPCName>Emily</>.//I'm one of the salon owners, along with my good friend <NPCName>Erika</>.
152_Text=You must have met my husband, surely. <NPCName>Sam</>, he runs the general store.//<portrait=concerned>Did he mention if he's met you or not? I can't remember.
28_Text=You want to know something, <PlayerName>$player</>? Pufferfish is only at this festival to convince us to sell our land.//<portrait=normal>How do I know? I overheard one of their employees talking about it.
133_Text=Yup, that’s roughly the amount of trash I see whenever I go out fishing.//So glad we can get some of it out of the ocean, <PlayerName>$player</>.
279_Text=...Festival? Oh, yeah, we do it every season.
181_Text=<NPCName>Anne</> was sad about the beavers.//And I think she’s right. The dark mood at the festival didn’t help.
136_Text=<NPCName>Archie</> got all of my food today.//<portrait=happy>He’s a growing boy, after all.
77_Text=<NPCName>Archie</>! Be careful with the worms!//*sighs* There he goes again…
25_Text=<NPCName>Archie’s</> having a blast with <NPCName>Valentina</>.
69_Text=<NPCName>Frank’s</> at the grill, so I skipped breakfast today.
302_Text=<NPCName>Mr. Joko</> over there taught us how to fish. It's fun so far!
72_Text=<NPCName>Mr. Theo</> is sooooo good at singing. I wanna be like him when I grow up.//What do you wanna do when you grow up?
112_Text=<NPCName>Walter</> was asking me questions about my coffee bean dealer. I’m not telling.//I know what he’s doing.
101_Text=<NpcName>Eva</>'s croissant is getting a lot of compliments, just for the looks.//Maybe I should ask her to add it to the menu.
303_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I finally met with the famous newbie farmer in town.//I’m <NPCName>Wakuu</>. I didn't expect us to meet here in the festival.
18_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! Oozing that chill aura today, mate!//<portrait=normal>Stay! <NPCName>Macy</> and I were just talking about her lobster, Timmy.
125_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! What did you bring for the potluck? Tell me!//<portrait=blushing>Oh, I got too excited there. Sorry.
11_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, are you ready for the main event?
274_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, right?//Nice to finally meet you! Name’s <NpcName>Pablo</>…//<portrait=normal>Come by my shop just north of town if you need help with farming tools. I’ll see what I can do.//Also, this is your first festival, right? Hopefully someone told you to bring something for the potluck.
94_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, we are finished with preparations for the main event.//Talk to the mayor if you’re ready.
84_Text=AAAAAH… The wind…the song…the food.//Perfection.
228_Text=After the festival, come by the inn if you want to hang out.
43_Text=Ah, here you are! The mayor and I are still getting ready for the festival.
6_Text=Ah, perhaps you’re not the gaming type.//Please sit tight. We’ll start soon!
258_Text=Ah, the new farmer... it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.//I’m <NPCName>Leah</>. I teach yoga around here. Only on the weekends, though.
280_Text=Ah, we've finally met! My name is <NPCName>Randy</>. I teach the kids around here.//We usually gather at that circular building just by the river in Woodlands.//<portrait=happy>My arm? It's an inappropriate story at festivals. Let's save it for another day.
264_Text=Ah, yes, the new farmer. Pleasure to meet you. My name is <NpcName>Luke</>.//How was the farm's appliances? I imagine it's not nearly up to standard.//Keep an eye out on the TV, maybe you'll find something interesting from my store, Socket & Pan.
145_Text=All right, my work here is done. Time to chill all the way home.
57_Text=And I’m going to open the festival with a song of my own.//<portrait=happy>Drives the crowds wild.
240_Text=Are you <PlayerName>$player</>, the new farmer?//<portrait=happy>It’s lovely to finally meet you. My name is <NpcName>Dinda</>.//<portrait=normal>I hope you enjoy your first festival here!
20_Text=Are you excited about this year’s potluck, dear?
53_Text=Are you saying hi to everybody?//You poor thing. It sounds exhausting.
3_Text=Are you sure? Hmm…//<portrait=normal>Okay, then, sit tight. We’ll start soon!
54_Text=BALAP KARUNG IS JUST RECIPE FOR PEOPLE MY AGE TO BREAK A HIP.
296_Text=But don't push yourself too hard and become isolated, okay?//<portrait=normal>It's fine to mingle with neighbors like us once in a while.//Especially during festivals like this.
61_Text=But there’s just something different about it here.//Is it the people, you think? They’re extra beautiful…//<portrait=blushing>The trees, I mean.
82_Text=Cooking is relaxing…//<portrait=happy>But it’s more relaxing to sit back, eat, and look at these cherry blossoms.
160_Text=Did you have fun?//I had a lot of fun today. I think I need to do more social activities like these…I don’t know.
200_Text=Did you like my performance?//Which one was your favorite?
306_Text=Do visit my outdoor coffee cafe if you have the time. If it's not raining, of course.
237_Text=Don't worry, we're not competitors. We only sell to businesses abroad,//<portrait=happy>so relax and enjoy the festival!

14_Text=Enjoying the view?//Oh, how I missed Spring.
122_Text=Even after the festival, the beavers didn’t appear at all.//Is it because of everyone’s gloomy mood…?
103_Text=GOOD FOOD, GOOD WEATHER, GOOD COMPANY.
172_Text=Glad you brought everyone’s attention to the potluck.//I was able to get more of <NPCName>Frank</>’s roasted mushrooms.

291_Text=Hey there! I’m <NpcName>Theo</>.//<portrait=normal>Welcome to your first festival! You’re that new farmer everyone's talking about, right?
47_Text=Hey ya, <PlayerName>$player</>! Looking forward to the potluck?//I’m bringing some stuff for <NPCName>Frank</>.
250_Text=Hey! The new farmer! I dont think we've ever formally met.//<portrait=normal>What festivals are for, right? To meet new people...and festivities, of course.
81_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>! How’s the festival?//<portrait=surprised>There’s more to come, don’t worry!
248_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>! Nice to finally meet the new farmer. I’m <NPCName>Frank</>.//I run Fishensips in front of the general store, and also the grill right now.
64_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>. Have you seen my dad?//<portrait=sad>Ah, he’s probably not coming, then. Too bad…
102_Text=Hey, come over here <PlayerName>$player</>! Let’s dance!
244_Text=Hey, new farmer! Welcome! Nice to finally meet you.//<portrait=normal>My name is <NpcName>Erika</>. Great festival, huh? Wait until you see the potluck!//By the way, my husband, <NpcName>Frank</>, will be the one cooking them. Have you two met?
144_Text=Hey, thanks again, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=happy>How about visiting the tavern later? I’ll get you some drinks, on the house!
272_Text=Hi there! My name is <NPCName>Oliver</>.//Are you the new farmer everyone is talking about?
301_Text=Hmmm? Oh!//Nice to meet you, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>. My name is <NPCName>Zoe</>.

26_Text=Hmm… Oh!//<portrait=normal>Sorry, didn’t see you there.//Looking forward to balap karung?
146_Text=Hmm… maybe the leftovers announcement was not a good idea.//<portrait=normal>But I think it’s important to let people know about it.
40_Text=Hmm…it’s still really chilly.//Thank Goddess I wore layers today.
206_Text=Home we go!
259_Text=How are things on the farm?//<portrait=concerned>It must be hard to suddenly farm after a desk job.
19_Text=Huh? Stephen?//<portrait=normal>Nah, mate… I’m pretty sure the lobster’s name is Timmy.
235_Text=I am here with my son, <NpcName>Noah</>. Do visit us in the tavern if you have the time, dear.
243_Text=I am sure you already met my husband, Sam.//<portrait=sad>But if you haven't, please say hi. He must be wondering why the new farmer hadn't given him any visit.
150_Text=I can understand the disappointment about the leftovers, but…//Why should it ruin the whole festival?
38_Text=I can’t talk to you about my work. I signed an NDA.
41_Text=I can’t think of a better way to celebrate Spring, to be honest.
138_Text=I can’t wait to rest.//A nice cup of tea to end the day would be perfect.
218_Text=I consider both the festival and my coffee a huge success today.//Hope you also enjoyed both, <PlayerName>$player</>.
219_Text=I consider both the festival and my coffee a huge success today.//No, I didn’t have a bite of the hotpot. It didn’t look appealing to me.
85_Text=I did say there’s way too much food, but…//<portrait=happy>I think it’s okay once in a while.
221_Text=I didn’t know the island had so many potential national sprinters.//<portrait=determined>Makes me proud.
58_Text=I don’t wanna fish. I wanna look for worms with Archie.//It’s more fun.
155_Text=I feel bad for suggesting that the food is more than enough already.//<portrait=normal>We will bring more in the future, I assure you.
96_Text=I got some fish, so I gave them to <NPCName>Mr. Frank</>.//<portrait=happy>I hope he can make it like <NPCName>Mr. Jim</>’s smoked salmon!
157_Text=I had fun. And the food wasn’t bad.
143_Text=I had so much fun today. And so much cake! We should do things like this more often.//I hope <NPCName>Betty</> shares her red velvet cake recipe with me.
76_Text=I hope they didn’t strain themselves doing the sack race.//You included, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>.
269_Text=I keep the books nice and tidy at the library, and also curate the museum.//Although it's still a bit empty at the moment.//Also, I usually work with <NpcName>Mayor Connor</> to organize festivals, like this one.//
182_Text=I like the hot pot today. I’ve never had it so delicious.
304_Text=I live in the observatory behind the vineyard with my housemate, <NPCName>Chaem</>.//Feel free to stop by any time.
80_Text=I love the food here. Everyhing is delicious!
45_Text=I love this song! So catchy!//Is it Seeing Stars by OneNation?
21_Text=I made red velvet cakes for everyone. I hope you like it.
42_Text=I need to take some selfies for my mom, though.//Ugh… Can’t do it in front of this many people.
176_Text=I played and ate a lot today.//<portrait=happy>And I learned how to fish too!
70_Text=I saw <NPCName>Oliver</> trying to catch fish at the lake earlier this morning. I think he wanted to contribute to the potluck.//<portrait=happy>So cute.
273_Text=I see. So your name is <PlayerName>$player</>. Nice to meet you, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>!//I am currently learning how to fish with <NPCName>Mr. Joko</>. It's fun!
161_Text=I should go home.
158_Text=I should go home. It’s getting late.
211_Text=I should really go home.//I miss my bed.
90_Text=I should’ve brought little <NPCName>Stephan</>. He would’ve enjoyed this.
147_Text=I think I ate too much today…//<portrait=normal>Walking all the way back to the ranch will help the digestion.
226_Text=I think I can make a better hotpot at home.//But hey, who am I to judge?
16_Text=I think I saw a couple of beavers swimming on the lake on my way here. Did you see them too?
87_Text=I think I spend way too much time at my PC.//<portrait=sad>My eyes feel kind of crusty.
208_Text=I think I’ll bring some leftovers home.//I can eat them tomorrow.
209_Text=I think I’ll bring some leftovers home.//Not the tastiest meal, but I’ve had worse. And I don’t want to be wasteful.
111_Text=I think I’ll wrap up some of this tumpeng for dad.//Do you think it’ll still be good later?
120_Text=I told <NPCName>Frank</> to give my portion to someone else.//<portrait=normal>I can get plenty to eat at the inn, so don’t worry about me.
292_Text=I usually fish from my boat and sing for a living, as you can see here.//<portrait=happy>If you wanna hear more of my singing, you should check the tavern out!
217_Text=I wasn’t a big fan of today’s hotpot.//At least the grill wasn’t that bad.
114_Text=I wonder how many people it took to get these decorations up.//It looks like a lot of work, if you ask me.
202_Text=I wrote some of the songs myself.//Though I did start off with OneNation’s songs.
247_Text=I'm a baker working for Sam's store currently.//<portrait=happy>I baked some croissant for the potluck. Have some later!
284_Text=I'm more excited about the dance.//<portrait=happy>Need to show off how the city moves, you know?
117_Text=I'm not interested in the sack race. I'm here for the potluck.
286_Text=I've been hearing a lot about the new farmer.//Still can't believe it was you. Anyway, welcome to the island!//Don't forget to visit me and <NPCName>Alice</> in the Coral Inn if you have the time.
196_Text=IT WAS FUN TO SEE YOU AND THE YOUNGSTERS DOING THE SACK RACE.//<portrait=laugh>MY KNEES WOULDN'T LET ME PARTICIPATE.
37_Text=If it weren’t for these festivals, I’d probably bury myself in work this week.//I’ve already missed some deadlines.
261_Text=If you do miss some of the city, maybe we can chat about it.//<portrait=sad>Oh! Um, if you don't mind, of course. Sorry if I'm being too nosy.
310_Text=If you have questions about bug catching, do let me know!//I’m the town bug nut, you could say.
241_Text=If you need furnitures, do visit my husband, <NpcName>Joko</>, and I at our carpenter shed.
67_Text=If you’re entering too, <PlayerName>$player</> –//<portrait=determined>I’m letting you know I’ll be playing to win.
31_Text=Is there a limit on how much food you can take?//Asking for a friend.
128_Text=It makes me happy to see everyone having fun.//<portrait=happy>Reminds me of the good old days…
98_Text=It sure is pretty today!//Can’t ask for better potluck weather.
116_Text=It's always a pleasure to spend my Spring here.//Well, part of my Spring anyway.
109_Text=It's chill here.//It's comforting.
263_Text=It's good to focus on your farm in the present.//But in the future, maybe it's better to take a look somewhere else too. The ocean, for example.
266_Text=It's nice to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. How was the island so far?//<portrait=happy>The island is kind of big, but if you can make it here, I'm sure you're familiar enough now.
56_Text=It’s a bit of a tradition for me to bring fresh fish to the Cherry Blossom Festival.//<portrait=happy>My dad would always bring his smoked salmon.
224_Text=It’s a long walk home. We better start walking soon.
152_Text=It’s always nice to see people smiling again.//<portrait=happy>And the cherry blossoms too, of course!
179_Text=It’s fine, <PlayerName>$player</>! This will only make the next festival better.//How do I know? Intuition, of course!
254_Text=It’s nice to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>So how was it? Was the past few days a fresh air, away from the city?
75_Text=It’s nice to see everyone enjoying the festival.
134_Text=It’s nice to see people kick back and relax at the festival.
283_Text=It’s very nice to finally meet you. You’re the new farmer in town, right?. I’m <NpcName>Scott</>.//So <PlayerName>$player</>, excited for our first festival? Yup, I'm new here too!
153_Text=It’s…not nice to see people frowning after seeing something so beautiful.//It’s a disservice to the cherry blossom.
108_Text=I’d better go tell <NPCName>Charles</> to calm down with the unsolicited doctor advice.//He could ruin the festival for everyone.
104_Text=I’ll bring over some lodeh next year.//It’s this delicious dish with coconut milk, you’ll love it.
308_Text=I’m a volleyball player and lifeguard at the beach.//<portrait=happy>If you do see me, don't hesitate to say hi.
17_Text=I’m bored with fishing, so I’m gonna look for worms with <NPCName>Valentina</>.//Sorry you can’t come.
186_Text=I’m glad <NPCName>Frank</> kept roasting apples right until the end.
239_Text=I’m one of the doctors in the town, with my colleague <NpcName>Yuri</>. //In case you missed her, she wears green scrub and has matching green hair.//<portrait=surprised>By the way, did you wear sunscreen? I have some, in case you didn't.
199_Text=I’m ready to go to bed.
140_Text=I’m ready to take my heels off. It’s a long day.
222_Text=I’m stuffed.//I just want to lie down and do nothing.
107_Text=Just like our wine, festivals like this are the identity of Coral Island.//<portrait=normal>Don’t you agree, <PlayerName>$player</>?
79_Text=Listen, <PlayerName>$player</>. Sometimes, getting to know everybody is tiring, but it’s worth it.//<portrait=happy>You’re part of this community now.
275_Text=Look forward to the grill too! I brought something special for it. You'll notice it!
282_Text=Look, <PlayerName>$player</>, I didn't mean to be rude.//But I am seriously concerned about your farm right now. Try to buy some seeds tomorrow, okay?//You can't only live with those starter seeds.
48_Text=Looking good, <PlayerName>$player</>!//<portrait=normal>Every festival is worth taking a day off for, I’m telling you.
139_Text=Loved loved loved the potluck. My husband killed it, like always.//Yeah…you too!
288_Text=Make sure to mention that to <NPCName>Frank</> at the grill.//<portrait=laugh>Hahaha!
95_Text=Mom spent the whole night baking.//<portrait=normal>I’m glad to see her having a good time today.
110_Text=Mom told me to keep an eye out for beavers while fishing!//Did you see any, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>?
71_Text=More people told me they saw beavers on the lake.//Thankfully, <NPCName>Paul</> brought his camera. If we’re lucky, we might get a picture or two.
265_Text=Must be a lot of work to switch careers.//<portrait=happy>But, seeing you here in the festival must meant you have it under control.
115_Text=My baby brother <NPCName>Frank</> is your guy for grilling stuff. A lot like dad.
312_Text=My brother, <NPCName>Frank</>, is manning the grill today.//That alone would be a big reason to get excited for today's festival.
35_Text=My dress is okay for this event, I hope.
59_Text=My favorite farmer!//<portrait=normal>How’s the farm?
214_Text=My mom and dad didn’t get any pictures of the beavers.//I didn’t see them while I was fishing either…
270_Text=Nice to finally meet you too, <PlayerName>$player</>!//My name is <NpcName>Noah</>. I live at the tavern, in the center of town.//<portrait=happy>I'm sure you went past it a few times when you're on an errand. Come visit us sometimes!
268_Text=Nice to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>. My name is <NpcName>Millie</>.//I hope you are enjoying yourself in this island. Not many people moved here to start farming.
256_Text=Nice to finally meet you, <PlayerName>$player</>… I’m <NPCName>Kira</>. I hunt for a living. Well, used to anyway.
289_Text=Nice to finally meet you... I’m <NPCName>Surya</>.//I heard people were talking about the new farmer. So that's you.//I just moved here too actually, for work.
232_Text=Nice to meet you too! The name is <NpcName>Ben</>.//<portrait=happy>To finally meet during the festival is a good omen.
13_Text=No rush, <PlayerName>$player</>. Maybe you could chat with people for a bit.
4_Text=No rush, <PlayerName>$player</>. The festival’s about immersion. Immerse yourself!
7_Text=No rush, <PlayerName>$player</>. We only have these games during festivals, so don’t miss out!
10_Text=No rush, <PlayerName>$player</>. With a potluck, it’s always the more the merrier.
51_Text=Oh gosh, it SURE is sunny today.//I should’ve brought my hat. I can feel my head heating up.//The mayor’s the smart one. He wears his hat everywhere.
167_Text=Oh no! I forgot to take pictures of people rushing towards the table. It would’ve made a great shot!
225_Text=Oh wow, I hope I didn’t eat too much today.//I get this nasty acid reflux if I have too much food in one sitting.
300_Text=Oh! I actually saw you before, hiking the woods.//<portrait=normal>No, not before the festival, but few years ago.//So, welcome back, I guess.
267_Text=Oh! Right, I’m <NpcName>Macy</>. I'm a photographer.//If you want a photograph of something, like your farm or pet, do let me know!
63_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>! Did you see the huge fish I caught?//<portrait=happy>I think I’m gonna get myself another one!
156_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>. Welcome back to the island.//I heard from people there's a new farmer, so it's you.//You can call me <NpcName>Alice</>.
297_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>? The new farmer everyone is talking about?//<portrait=happy>It’s nice to finally meet you! I’m <NPCName>Yuri</>.//I heard that you're from Pokyo, so this wouldn't be your first cherry blossoms.
39_Text=Oh, I almost forgot to bring something to the potluck today.//<portrait=normal>Good thing we had extra strawberries in the fridge.//I don’t know how long they were there, to be honest. I don’t even remember buying them… Oh well!
271_Text=Oh, I hope someone told you to bring something for the potluck.//<NpcName>Frank</> will be grilling all day, although I'm still not sure about it...
242_Text=Oh, finally, our new neighbor. It’s very nice to meet you! I’m <NPCName>Emily</>.//My husband, Sam, runs the general store.//While me and my friend <NPCName>Erika</> run the hair salon.//<portrait=happy>We can help you with different styles if you want. Just stop by!
255_Text=Oh, forgive me if I sound too prying.//<portrait=normal>It's just so fascinating to see people from the city moving here.//I hope you enjoy the festival!
311_Text=Oh, hello! I don’t think we’ve met. I’m <NPCName>Aaliyah</>.//You must be the new farmer. Everyone in town was talking about you.
55_Text=Oh, hey, you!//<portrait=concerned>I didn’t get to sleep until 2 am. I’m so sleepy.
249_Text=Oh, if you want to contribute to the potluck, put them in the table here.//<portrait=happy>I hope you didn't bring some rock or wood for it!
285_Text=Oh, it really is you, <PlayerName>$player</>. It’s me, <NpcName>Suki</>!//It's been a long time, isn't it.//How’s the farm so far?
260_Text=Oh, it’s nice to finally meet you.//I’m <NpcName>Lily</>… We probably haven't met yet since I was swamped with work.
246_Text=Oh, nice to finally meet you!//<portrait=happy>My name is <NpcName>Everest</>…//<portrait=normal><NpcName>Eva</> for short.
277_Text=Oh, now we're just taking a break to enjoy the festival.//<portrait=happy>But who knows, some beavers might shows up. Haha!
281_Text=Oh. It's the new farmer. I suppose you're not too busy for the festival then?//<portrait=unimpressed>Unlike my store which can help you with your farm, of course.
278_Text=Oh… um, nice to finally meet you. <portrait=happy>My name is <NPCName>Rafael</>.//<portrait=normal>I suppose you’re settling in fine. I’m one of the blacksmiths here in Starlet Town.//The other blacksmith is my brother, <NPCName>Pablo</>.
52_Text=OneNation songs are the best!//My favorite is I Did. Have you heard that one?
169_Text=Oof, I think I went a bit overboard with the pizzas.//I’m so stuffed.
27_Text=Ooh! Looking gorgeous, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=happy>I’m impressed. Who cut your hair?//Was it me? It was me, wasn’t it? Looks like my work.
93_Text=Please wait just a little longer, we’re still preparing for the main event.//Frank is still accepting contributions for the potluck. How about visiting him?
92_Text=Please wait just a little longer, we’re still preparing for the main event.//People are still playing games. How about giving them a try?
91_Text=Please wait just a little longer, we’re still preparing for the main event.//You should try the minigames!
29_Text=Ready for some intense grilling?
68_Text=Seeing these cherry blossoms here is so special.
165_Text=Shall we go home? I think the event is done.
46_Text=Shh!!! <NPCName>Mr. Joko</> said we can’t be too loud, or the fish will swim away.
210_Text=Should I go home or should I go to the beach?
105_Text=Sing along, <PlayerName>$player</>! Come on, you know the next part, right?
97_Text=Smells good, right? I gathered dried coconut husk for the grill this morning.//We’ve been grilling with dried coconut husk for generations. <NPCName>Frank</>’s super excited about it.
99_Text=So much good food on the table.//<portrait=concerned>Maybe I should calm down with the tumpeng and save some space for them…
307_Text=So you're the new farmer, huh? Everyone's been talking about you.//Great to meet you. I’m <NPCName>Chaem</>.
124_Text=That was fun! The sack race was awesome!
119_Text=That was refreshing.//<portrait=normal>A nice break from the everyday routine. Don’t you feel the same, <PlayerName>$player</>?
230_Text=That's good to hear!//<portrait=normal>Keep an eye out for beavers on the lake if you're interested in animals. You can observe them, but be sure to keep a safe distance.//<portrait=concerned>We don't wanna spook them...
9_Text=That’s…unfortunate.//Okay, then, sit tight. We’ll start soon!
15_Text=The cherry blossoms look beautiful, don’t they?//<portrait=happy><NPCName>Rafael</> seems to agree.
49_Text=The cherry blossoms look pretty, but…//<portrait=normal>With this many people, I think I’ll need a whole week to recuperate.//<portrait=concerned>Sorry.
89_Text=The food is way too heavy for me.
131_Text=The food today was…interesting, isn’t it?//Aren’t you glad I brought my homemade dish?
212_Text=The food wasn’t that bad, I don’t think.//But it certainly wasn’t great.
66_Text=The karung race looks interesting. Maybe I could practice my jump.
83_Text=The kids aren’t even stopping for a break.//<portrait=happy>Looks like I managed to reel them into fishing! What about you? Are you fishing these days?
65_Text=The mayor let me be a sponsor. My brew is the official coffee of the Cherry Blossom Festival!//<portrait=happy>I used the special Sumatran beans. Only the best for Starlet townies.
166_Text=The mayor should do a better job in the future.//Honestly, this is a disgrace to the town.
287_Text=The new farmer! We've finally met. My name is <NPCName>Sunny</>.//<portrait=happy>My friend <NPCName>Jim</> and I run the best seafood place in town.
86_Text=The songs <NPCName>Theo</> sang really fit the mood.//<portrait=happy>He’s not a bad-looking—I mean, not a bad singer.//<portrait=angry>You heard nothing.
74_Text=The tumpeng is over there, dear.//<portrait=normal>I hope it's enough for everybody.
34_Text=There’s way too much food here.//<portrait=annoyed>We could feed the whole town for a week!
129_Text=These kinds of things do happen from time to time, dear.//<portrait=normal>Try not to dwell on it.
290_Text=This will be our first festival then. Glad to see a fellow newcomer.
73_Text=Time to absorb the good vibes.//Breathe in energy… Breathe out stress… Aaaaah…
163_Text=Time to go home!
137_Text=To tell you the truth, <PlayerName>$player</>, Sam and I are worried sick.//We’re losing distributors every day and really wondering about the future.//<portrait=happy>But seeing everyone’s smiles makes me optimistic again.
113_Text=Today is a rest day for me.//What?
204_Text=Today was a lot of fun! I hope <NPCName>Nina</> can be here too next year!
213_Text=Today was fun! I got to fish a lot,//<portrait=happy>And my mom and dad got pictures of beavers!
148_Text=We brought a lot for the potluck today.//But maybe it wasn’t enough.
23_Text=We brought plenty of dishes and raw vegetables, of course. You can’t bring just one thing to events like this.//People might think we’re not grateful for the invite…or worse, that we’re poor. Oh gosh!
121_Text=We got some pictures of the beavers in the lake!//<portrait=normal>I hope more of them come back in the future.
44_Text=We worked really hard on it. You like?
132_Text=Well done, <PlayerName>$player</>. Everyone is going home smiling.//Who knew an announcement like that would have such an effect?
238_Text=Well, hello, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m <NpcName>Charles</>.//It’s nice to finally meet you.//<portrait=happy>I trust you're healthy enough to be away from the clinic for all these time?
154_Text=Well, that’s enough relaxing for one day.//<portrait=annoyed>Those monsters aren’t going to wait around any longer, I’m sure.
251_Text=Well, welcome to Coral Island. I’m Jack.//<portrait=happy>I run the local ranch. You’ve probably already heard of my wife, Kira.//<portrait=normal>If you anything related to animals, I'll be at my ranch.
5_Text=We’re still getting ready for the main event. Maybe you can play some games while you wait.
8_Text=We’re still getting ready for the main event. Maybe you could contribute to the potluck before it starts.
2_Text=We’re still getting ready for the main event. You have some time to contribute to the potluck and play a few games.
33_Text=What a day to be outdoors.//<portrait=normal>The sun is so bright. Good thing I brought my hat.
188_Text=What a day… What a day!
236_Text=What a delight! It's our new neighbor! I’m so excited to have another farmer in Coral Island.//<portrait=happy><NpcName>Walter</> and I own the vineyard.//We brought some samples to the festival if you want to try some!
149_Text=What a great day! I ate a lot, and taught the kids about fishing.
135_Text=What a great festival! I hope everyone had fun today.//<portrait=normal>I also hope you enjoyed your first festival, <PlayerName>$player</>.
151_Text=What a way to end the festival!//Even if I don’t get your food, I’m still satisfied with what I got. It’s so delicious!
28_Text=What did you bring for the potluck?//<portrait=happy>I baked some croissants. Have some later!
194_Text=What did you bring, anyway? It’s a secret? Huh.//<portrait=happy>Well, whatever it is, I’m glad everyone is going home full and happy.
36_Text=What do you think?//Is pink my color?
127_Text=Whew! I’m full after apple bobbing all day.//<portrait=happy>I always end up chewing through all of ’em!
171_Text=Whew, our work isn’t finished yet. Now it’s time to clean up.//Don’t worry, <PlayerName>$player</>. You can go on home. We’ll take care of things here.
162_Text=Whoever brought the spring fritatta to the potluck has my gratitude.//<portrait=happy>It was delicious.
295_Text=Why, hello there. My name is <NPCName>Walter</>. Nice to finally meet our fellow farmer.//I heard the farm is doing rather well. Good job!
216_Text=With a clear sky like this, I think we can see stars clearly tonight.//I’m gonna stay up a bit and see.
177_Text=Wow, did <NPCName>Rafael</> just run with the crowd? That was something.//<portrait=happy>Thanks for letting me see that, <PlayerName>$player</>.
118_Text=Wow, good job, <PlayerName>$player</>. That was really kind of you. The festival has a happy ending now.//<portrait=blushing>Huh? I sound like my sister?
178_Text=Wow, that was fun. Didn’t know a sack race could be so intense!//<portrait=sad>I think I threw my back out, though.
130_Text=Wow, that was more tiring than I thought!//<portrait=normal>I’m going to be taking a nice long bath tonight.
78_Text=Wow, the potluck looks amazing!//<portrait=concerned>But… Oh, never mind.
106_Text=Yay! <NPCName>Mr. Theo</> is finally singing a good song!
191_Text=Yeah! This is what I’m talking about. Good food, good music!
190_Text=Yeah! This is what I’m talking about. Good food, good music!//I feel energized! I think I’ll go home and do some reps.
294_Text=Yeah, it's fun during festivals.//<portrait=happy>And it's also fun during winter. You get to fly kites and build snowmen!
141_Text=You don’t look tired at all.//You must be very fit.
174_Text=You know what, I take back whatever I said about <NPCName>Frank</>.//<portrait=happy>He can make some great stuff, especially the roasted mushrooms.
245_Text=You know what, you should stop the tavern, after this.//<portrait=normal><NpcName>Frank</> and I will treat you to some drinks.//<portrait=happy>Gosh! That sounds wonderful. Yes! You can tell us your farm story!
88_Text=You look like you’re having fun.//It’s not all bad hanging out in open air like this, is it?
180_Text=You should’ve seen the look on Anne’s face when we got the beavers’ pictures.
60_Text=You’re from Pokyo, right, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I’m from Tosaka, so cherry blossoms shouldn’t be anything new for us.
154_Text=*burps* Ugh, too many mooncakes…
32_Text=<NPCName>Alice</> is really into making the lanterns at today’s festival.//<portrait=concerned><NPCName>Valentina</>, on the other hand…
28_Text=<NPCName>Annie’s</> a bit bothered about the lanterns, but I’ll reassure her.
137_Text=<NPCName>Annie’s</> managed to relax a bit and enjoy the festival.//She deserves it.
61_Text=<NPCName>Betty’s</> mooncakes are just the best. Maybe I should make try making some too…
11_Text=<NPCName>Dippa</> and I will just relax at today’s festival.//That means no tacos later. Instead, go get some mooncakes.
46_Text=<NPCName>Oliver</> told me about what he’ll be doing during the festival. I’m so proud of him!
125_Text=<NPCName>Theo</> and <NPCName>Lily</> need to appreciate festivals like this more.//<portrait=concerned>Soon, they’ll have their own families to go with, and they may not be able to go together.
3_Text=<PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>! Are you ready for the festival?//I’m gonna go fishing later with my friends!
52_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! Oh, you missed the best part. I just told a story about meeting a slime at the mine.//<portrait=normal>It was intense!
83_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, are you ready with the crops?//<portrait=normal>Don’t worry too much about the competition. It’s all in good fun!
131_Text=A couple of flies landed on the food earlier.//I’d eat some yogurt when I got home, if I were you.
142_Text=AH! THE AIR IS CHILLY AND FRESH.
127_Text=Aaaaah…
105_Text=All these lanterns remind me of a festival I attended a long time ago…
82_Text=And of course the massive cow over there! Have you seen it?
51_Text=And then I told that slime to scram! Luckily, it agreed. Close call!
24_Text=Are you entering the cooking contest?//My bet’s on <NPCName>Jack</>.
72_Text=Are you happy today?
98_Text=Aunt <NPCName>Dinda’s</> been testing out new recipes at home for the cooking contest.//Dinners have been great!//And interesting at times.
4_Text=Bringing anything for the Harvest Festival?
91_Text=But I don’t mind. It’s the least I can do since I’m not that good at other things.
97_Text=DON'T BE TOO FOCUSED ON BUSINESS, <NPCName>SAM</>.//<portrait=laugh>RELAX AND ENJOY THE FESTIVAL.
150_Text=Dad would like some mooncakes, so I asked <NPCName>Betty</> for a few to take home.
133_Text=Did you see a hole in the big cow?//I need to check it and send it to be fixed.
66_Text=Do you want to join our table?
88_Text=Don’t worry about winning. Just have fun!
76_Text=Enjoy it, <PlayerName>$player</>. You don’t see these kinds of things in Pokyo.
94_Text=Even though it’s always crowded in the city, people there are distant.//It’s intimate here… I like it.
109_Text=Fall must be a busy time for you.
56_Text=Fancy seeing you here!
70_Text=Farmer! It’s your festival, isn’t it? It’s the festival of the farmers, my mom always said.//No, no she didn’t. I made that part up.
149_Text=Finally, everyone just had fun fishing.//<portrait=happy>I can go home happy now!
1_Text=Going to the festival later, <PlayerName>$player</>? If I were you, I’d keep my stomach empty.//<portrait=happy><NPCName>Betty’s</> going to be handing out mooncakes later. And they’re good!
102_Text=Good luck against Beluga, <PlayerName>$player</>.//We need to teach them a lesson.
81_Text=Good thing I brought lots of film for today! I’m gonna take some photos of the giant chicken later.
13_Text=Good thing it isn’t raining today.
37_Text=Good to see you!
49_Text=Have you tried the mooncakes yet?
59_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>! Are you interested in carpentry too, like this young man? We’d be more than happy to teach you.
17_Text=Hmm, I shouldn’t eat too much before today’s festival.//Got to leave room for <NPCName>Betty’s</> mooncakes.
20_Text=How are you doing today?
23_Text=I brought some film for today, but I’m thinking of buying more.//<portrait=happy>Can’t be too careful!
8_Text=I brought some fishing rods for the kids. Hopefully, they have fun at today’s festival!
14_Text=I can’t wait to start. It’s gonna be a good day!//I can feel it.
138_Text=I don’t mind packing up for free.//It’s for the community anyway, but Mr. Mayor insisted on paying us for it.
145_Text=I get to stay up today! Yay!
89_Text=I gotta learn to make mooncakes.//You’re a farmer, right? Do you know how to make them?
9_Text=I guess I have to go to the festival today. I don’t want to hear any more nagging from <NPCName>Emma</>.
119_Text=I had a blast. It was great to see the bountiful harvest this year!
34_Text=I haven’t eaten any mooncakes yet, so I’m excited for the festival later.
107_Text=I hope to uncover the mystery one day.
62_Text=I hope you’re having a good time,<PlayerName>$player</>!
104_Text=I just like looking at the decorations.
69_Text=I like coming to events like this sometimes. I get to do my all socializing at once.//Then I can use my spare time to do something more useful.
130_Text=I like hanging out here…//Do we have to leave soon?
101_Text=I like the Harvest Festival. Nana said it’s her favorite festival in the world.
63_Text=I love it here. I think this spot has the best view.
100_Text=I might do one about someone getting run over by the massive chicken on the way here.//Oh yeah! That’d be a hit.
112_Text=I need to sleep.
132_Text=I overslept today.//Good thing I didn’t miss the festival!
65_Text=I really like your outfit today. I think it’s very flattering.
20_Text=I should get things ready for the festival later. I don’t want to miss the beautiful moon.
57_Text=I think I ate too many mooncakes. But I just can’t stop myself from taking more…
77_Text=I think I might dance later.
152_Text=I think all that sugar’s entering my system now. I’m crashing. Bleeeeeh…
30_Text=I think the Beluga farmer will be at the festival later for the competition.//I’m not interested in doing business with that snob, though.
134_Text=I think this is late enough for my mom.//She needs to get home and rest.
111_Text=I try to get <NPCName>Zoe</> home before it gets too dark.
7_Text=I want to see what people come up with in the cooking contest today.//Hopefully, I’ll get to learn a new recipe.
22_Text=I wonder how many people will participate today.
86_Text=I won’t be fishing today. Looking for bugs is more exciting!
50_Text=I won’t lose to <NPCName>Valentina</>! I can catch five fish too!
33_Text=I'M HAPPY FOLKS STILL HOLD THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.
92_Text=If <NPCName>Betty’s</> interested in selling her mooncakes at the store,//I could have a business discussion with her.
44_Text=If I were you, I’d stay off the sweets today, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Mom’s going all out for the Mooncake Festival.
6_Text=If there’s one thing I’m not looking forward to today, it’s meeting the farmers from Beluga.
75_Text=In the city, there’s just so much light pollution we can barely see the moon.
118_Text=Is it done? Are we allowed to go home yet?
140_Text=It’s good to compete. It builds bonds between the teams.//Everyone is a good sport today!
96_Text=It’s my ex-mother-in-law’s favorite festival.//And I think it might be mine too… I haven’t decided yet.
128_Text=It’s nice to see <NPCName>Charles</> out. He has a good heart, that one. Just a little odd sometimes.//I guess the same thing can be said about me.//The odd part…
74_Text=It’s not a bad idea to come here every now and then. I should do it more often.
103_Text=I’d feel better losing to you than losing to Beluga’s farmers.
78_Text=I’ll ask my brother if he wants to dance with me. I don’t wanna do it alone.
21_Text=I’ll be making some lanterns later for the festival.//<portrait=concerned>It’s kind of a chore, for me at least…
116_Text=I’ll lay off the sweets for a while. Those mooncakes will satisfy my cravings for weeks.
36_Text=I’ll show my fishing skills at today’s festival!
90_Text=I’m a bit tired after getting the festival ready. Those giant papier-mâché animals are very heavy!
108_Text=I’m cold. I think I want some hot cocoa.
124_Text=I’m full, but I think I can manage a couple more mooncakes.
99_Text=I’m getting lots of inspiration for my new song!
120_Text=I’m glad <NPCName>Dippa</> agreed to come today. It looks like they had a really good time.
135_Text=I’m going to show Mom the bugs I got today!
144_Text=I’m going to start writing down my song tomorrow.//Calling it Nana Got Run Over by a Massive Chicken. Eh? What do you think?
114_Text=I’m happy if everyone goes home with a full belly.//I hope yours is full too, dear.
68_Text=I’m having fun.
121_Text=I’m helping <NPCName>Millie</> clean up for a bit.
45_Text=I’m just looking forward to the free cakes at the festival.//Don’t really care about anything else.
25_Text=I’m kind of looking forward to making lanterns with <NPCName>Lily</> today. It reminds me of our childhood.
5_Text=I’m looking forward to seeing all the harvest displays.
67_Text=I’m not cooking today. Just enjoying the day with my beautiful wife here…//<portrait=annoyed>Uh, where is she?
73_Text=I’m only here to see <NPCName>Jack</> compete.
110_Text=I’m ready to call it a night.
93_Text=I’ve never seen anything like this before! Things are different back in the city.
39_Text=Making lanterns at the festival should be easier for me this year. I’ve been practicing too.
84_Text=Making these lanterns with <NPCName>Alice</> really brought back some good memories.
48_Text=Maybe later. I’ve been going back and forth a lot.//People notice, you know.
153_Text=Maybe watch your mooncake fillings next year!//You might get one of my mystery ones. Ha ha ha!
80_Text=Mom always does. Let’s see what she has in mind this year.
129_Text=Mom never took me to events like these. It was always Dad…//Huh. I don’t know why I’m telling you this.
117_Text=Mooncakes are special, for sure.//It’s even more special to eat them in the moonlight.
139_Text=My cousin needs to report on our festival.//She works for the weather channel, but she might know somebody.
64_Text=My favorite neighbor is here.//What have you been up to?
26_Text=My friends invited me to go fishing during the festival today, but that’s boring.//Instead, I’m going to look for bugs.
136_Text=My job here isn’t done yet. My brother and I are staying to pack up.
126_Text=My stomach can’t hold any more mooncakes! Time for some good sleep after this.
58_Text=No worries, <NPCName>Rafael</>. It’s fun once you get the hang of it!
147_Text=Outdoor activities are good for mental health.
16_Text=People used to make lanterns before the festival.//<portrait=concerned>But nowadays, we’re making them during the festival.
148_Text=Putting the lantern-making thing aside, it’s a fun festival. I can see myself going again next year.
123_Text=Relax! You don’t have to leave right away.
47_Text=Should I get more mooncakes, you think?
54_Text=So, listen up. Tickets for the festival. You’d need a separate ticket to enter the contest. What do you say?//I think it’s a brilliant idea, if I say so myself.
29_Text=Some people look forward to the cakes or the competition at the festival.//But personally, I can’t wait to relax and watch the moon.
155_Text=That really was fun, wasn’t it?
38_Text=The crops competition can be a bit intimidating, but try to not let it stress you, <PlayerName>$player</>.
85_Text=The crops competition, though—sometimes it gets a little bit…intense for some folks.
2_Text=The festival will be great, but…//<portrait=concerned>There’s just something bothering me about the lanterns.
41_Text=The moon should be up later during the festival. No telescope needed!
95_Text=The mooncakes, the ambience… Everything is always great this time of year.
141_Text=The night wind is chilly now.//Winter is coming.
87_Text=The pumpkin smash is so much fun. You should give it a try!
106_Text=The temple right there, the one in the middle of this lake—it’s full of mystery.
71_Text=The trees are happy today… So am I.
143_Text=This harvest celebration goes back hundreds of years.
35_Text=This is one of the festivals we’re known for.//The other one is the Cherry Blossom Festival… I’m pretty sure.
10_Text=This is the day when I can finally taste <NPCName>Betty’s</> pastry again.
15_Text=Those Beluga farmers always go all out for the crop display contest.
12_Text=Today could be a headache if <NPCName>Frank</> goes overboard with the mooncakes again.
18_Text=Today’s festival should be fun, especially with <NPCName>Betty’s</> delicious mooncakes.
60_Text=Usually, I don’t go to these festivals. But since <NPCName>Emma</> insisted…
115_Text=We all had a good run.
122_Text=We should have a cookout more often.
146_Text=Well, the Beluga farmer will be back next year. Plenty of time to prepare, <PlayerName>$player</>.
151_Text=What a life! Plenty of food. Great music! Great company!
113_Text=What a way to end my Fall here.//Getting ready to take off soon.
40_Text=What else needs to be done?
43_Text=Why are you standing there?
79_Text=Will you be entering the cooking contest?
55_Text=You agree with me on that one, eh, old sport?
27_Text=You better keep an empty stomach, there, <PlayerName>$player</>. Lots of food at the festival later!
42_Text=You look like you’re ready to have fun!
53_Text=You look relaxed, dear.
31_Text=You should try making lanterns at the festival, <PlayerName>$player</>!//<portrait=normal>They’re making some for the lake. Ancient tradition, I suppose.
61_Text=*<NPCName>Theo</> is singing—better not bother him.*
5_Text=*She seems busy*
64_Text=*munches* How do they even do it…?
56_Text=*sighs* I can feel it. The museum is going to go through a rough patch again.
60_Text=<NPCName>BEN</> HAS A VERY INTERESTING WAY OF SEEING THINGS.//<portrait=happy>I STILL DISCOVER NEW THINGS, EVEN IN MY OLD AGE. IT'S WONDROUS. HEH HEH.
43_Text=<NPCName>Bree</> hired me to take official pics of today’s party.
9_Text=<NPCName>Bree</> paid me a good amount to cover the whole event.//Love this gig!
41_Text=<NPCName>Connor</> and <NPCName>Millie</> helped a lot with setting up the chairs and tables.
46_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> really doted on <NPCName>Aaliyah</> in the past. That’s why they’re so close.
6_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> wanted us to come early to help out with the preparation.//I don’t mind. <NPCName>Bree</> always has plenty of snacks around.
33_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> won’t be happy seeing me getting another piece of cake. Heh heh.//<portrait=happy>AIN’T THAT RIGHT, HON?
3_Text=<NPCName>Luke’s</> family is like my own family. Of course I’m here.//Fun time ahead, mate.
36_Text=<NPCName>Randy’s</> prosthetic arm looks really interesting…//I might have an idea or two about how he can use it more efficiently.
40_Text=<NPCName>Theo</> and I used to play the balloon game too, like kids.//<portrait=annoyed>We always kicked the balloon way too hard, and it popped.
58_Text=<NPCName>Zarah’s</> stories are really fun. She should hang out at the inn sometime.
17_Text=<PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>, is there a trick to this game? It’s kinda hard.
57_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I didn’t notice you there.//<portrait=happy>You’re ready with the gifts? I heard this year’s raffle will be better than last year’s!
12_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! If you want to see some fireworks, come to the summit later during the party.//<portrait=happy><NPCName>Rafael</> and I got some good stuff this year!
21_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I’m so glad to see you. Welcome to the party!//<portrait=happy>How about grabbing some minced jackfruit pie? They’re my pride and joy today.
65_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, have you tried the cake?//<portrait=happy>It’s so good. I’ll grab another piece!
51_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, you wanna light some sparklers too?//<portrait=happy>Too bad, these are the last! Heh heh.
80_Text=Besides lending us the chairs, the town also helped us close out the party with a bang.//It was a great success, I must say.
30_Text=Crazy how the year goes so fast, eh, <PlayerName>$player</>?
8_Text=Does that table in the middle look tilted to you?
87_Text=Eating good food and watching fireworks isn’t a bad way to end the year.
54_Text=Errr, umm, hi. Didn’t see you there, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Please forget what you just saw.
72_Text=Evening, <PlayerName>$player</>. You like pie?//I prefer the wine, personally.
69_Text=Everything here is so elegant. The wine, the atmosphere…
23_Text=Everything in moderation, right, <PlayerName>$player</>? Too much pie will do you no good.
32_Text=From here, everything looks so bright down there.//<portrait=happy>It’s kind of relaxing.
22_Text=Go! Go mingle! Enjoy yourself!
83_Text=HAPPY NEW YEAR!
76_Text=Happiest new year to you!
81_Text=Happy new year, <PlayerName>$player</>! I took great photos of you tonight.
27_Text=Here alone, <PlayerName>$player</>? Are we looking forward to seeing anyone here?//By “we” I mean “you”…
62_Text=Hmm, are you good at this balloon game, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>?//It’s a bit hard to keep the balloon in the air…
73_Text=Hmm. I don’t eat things like this every day at the guild.
39_Text=Hmm? Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>. Here for the scenery?//<portrait=happy>It’s great, trust me.
26_Text=I always adore New Year’s Eve dinner parties. We’re ending the year with a bang!
67_Text=I get to stay up late tonight.
14_Text=I got here too early, didn’t I?//I didn’t wanna be late…
77_Text=I had a great time. I think I’m going to go home after helping <NPCName>Bree</> for a bit.
47_Text=I hope <NPCName>Aaliyah</> feels…uh, more at home now.
28_Text=I hope I’m wearing enough layers tonight.
7_Text=I hope this year’s fireworks will be grander than last year’s.
55_Text=I hope you brought enough gifts for the raffle, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=happy>Let’s just say I envy you for being able to participate. The prizes are really good.
18_Text=I left my crystals out to charge before I came here.
31_Text=I think the wine today made everything go faster too! Heh heh.
85_Text=I wasn’t so lucky with the raffle this year.//<portrait=happy>But at least I ate good food and saw some great fireworks!
133_Text=Is it too early to say Happy New Year?
86_Text=It's Spring already, no?
70_Text=It's pretty cold. Good thing we're all wrapped up.
29_Text=It’s only getting started, and I can feel the chill in my bones.
34_Text=It’s really fun to talk about all sort of things with <NPCName>Surya</>.//He’s really passionate about his field.
11_Text=I’m all in for some great free wine later at the New Year’s party.
82_Text=I’m glad everyone went home happy after our fireworks show.
25_Text=I’m glad to see <NPCName>Aaliyah</> today!//<portrait=normal>She’s usually away for training.
84_Text=I’m sure everybody will be asking for a hangover cure after all that wine.
35_Text=Maybe I can help with his research sometime later.
4_Text=Oh gosh, you’re here already.//It isn’t ready, but please make yourself at home. Have some amuse-bouches.//We had them catered from Pokyo.
45_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>! Good to see you. We’re working with <NPCName>Bree</> at today’s New Year’s party.//The raffle will start soon.
19_Text=Oh, it’s good to see you all dressed up.
10_Text=People are starting to come! Oh my gosh!
42_Text=Please help yourself.
79_Text=Thank you for coming!//I hope you had a good time. Have a great year ahead, my dear.
24_Text=That being said, this is my fourth piece of pie today…//<portrait=normal>Oh, well. Do as I say, not as I do!
16_Text=These pies are great! <NPCName>Bree</> really went all out this year.//<portrait=normal>I hope she’ll have them next year.
48_Text=This game is so much fun!
66_Text=This is pretty fun.
68_Text=This pie is just the right stuff for it. Yum.
44_Text=To be honest, I would’ve done it for free. So nice of her!
75_Text=Today’s atmosphere is so festive. Perfect for some wine drinking.
2_Text=Umm…where’s <NPCName>Taco</>?
78_Text=WHOA!!! YOU SEE ALL THOSE FIREWORKS?
49_Text=We need to be careful, though. <NPCName>Lily</> says somebody once kicked the balloon so hard it popped!
63_Text=Welcome to our New Year’s party, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Don’t be shy, and grab some food. We’ve got plenty today.
13_Text=Well… I guess it hasn’t started.
53_Text=Whoosh! Evil monsters, prepare to meet your end by my Sword of—
37_Text=Wine, fireworks… It’s a perfect ending to the year.
50_Text=Woo-hoo! Good thing we saved some for this year, right, <NPCName>Rafael</>?!
74_Text=You better grab some before it runs out.
38_Text=You don't look bad tonight.
52_Text=You know what’s better than this cake?//<portrait=happy>Collaboration! <NPCName>Ling</> just told me about some interesting projects.
15_Text=You know, we basically invented time to make sense of it.
20_Text=You remind me of a young Blythe Moss…
59_Text=You too, <PlayerName>$player</>. How about making it a New Year’s resolution?//<portrait=happy>Hang out at the inn and maybe spend some nights too. We’ll give you a discount!
1_Text=You’re early too, huh?//I’m helping out with the food.
13_Text=<NPCName>Chaem</> is fun to play volleyball with. She's really good...//Learning a lot of tricks and stuff from her.
4_Text=<NPCName>Frank</> will be manning the grill, and my brother is more or less the grill master of Coral Island, so…
8_Text=Are you going to <NPCName>Bree</>'s for the New Year’s feast? It’s going to be a good time!
5_Text=Did you enjoy the Cherry Blossom Festival? I ate so much I could hardly walk home!
21_Text=Do you have more layers to wear at home?//<portrait=normal>Winter is next week and it seems like it might be a cold one this year.
11_Text=Don’t let Mama hear me say that, though. She seems to think I’m home for good.//It’ll be easier for everyone if we let her keep thinking that, until I have to leave again.
7_Text=Enjoying Spring so far?
25_Text=I can't imagine going to the hotspring in this heat.//But I heard from my friend, <NPCName>Chaem</>, the dude with scar on his face goes there in Summer.
6_Text=I don't mind the cold weather and stuff, but nothing... and I mean, <Italic>nothing</> beats eating outdoor.//Doing it in Spring is of course, much better than doing it in the middle of ice cold Winter afternoon.
23_Text=I'm A-OK to spend my whole Summer at the beach, playing volleyball.//But the thing is, I can't seem to find any other partner except for <NPCName>Chaem</>.
2_Text=I’m <NPCName>Aaliyah</>.
20_Text=Mama’s been baking up a storm lately. I keep telling her, don’t tempt me – I have to stay in shape!//But then she waves a chocolate chip muffin under my nose and that’s it, I’m gone.
9_Text=My brothers and I used to build snow forts in weather like this. Our snowball wars were epic!
10_Text=Now that I’m home, I don’t get to fly as much as I had been… I miss it! I’m itching to get back in the cockpit again.
22_Text=Now that it's Fall, Mama can't stop baking mooncakes at home.//<portrait=happy>It's not that I want her to anyway. Heh heh!
1_Text=Oh, hello! I don’t think we’ve met.
12_Text=Or maybe that makes it worse…? I just don’t want unnecessary conflict, is all.//Not while I’m living under the same roof with her.
3_Text=Planning to go to the Cherry Blossom Festival, <PlayerName>$player</>? You don’t want to miss it!
14_Text=When I was in basic training, they made us camp out for three days in weather like this. A test of endurance.
24_Text=Yeah, <NPCName>Paul</> and <Italic>stuff</> are there sometimes. Just not often enough, you know.
18_Text=You know what I’m craving right now, <PlayerName>$player</>? A nice, hot cup of coffee…//I'm gonna go and get some.
19_Text=You know, I’m glad to be back on Coral Island, but it’s not quite the same without my dad and my little brother here.
138_Text=*<NPCName>Alice</> is ignoring you*
145_Text=*<NPCName>Alice</> seems to be working*
11_Text=*yawn*
4_Text=...//Is there something you needed from me?
5_Text=...//Yes?
126_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> and <NPCName>Joko</> are very talented. They made some of our cabinets.//I wonder how long it took them to get so good at carpentry.
164_Text=<NPCName>Karen</> used to have a room at the inn before she rented that space over there.
127_Text=<NPCName>Noah</> wanted to open a booth with the information we gathered on flying saucers.
73_Text=<NPCName>Rafael</>? Yeah, he might be at the inn today.//He does visit us on Sunday when he can.
18_Text=<NPCName>Suki</> and I divide our workload.//I get the weekday shift, and she covers the weekend.
153_Text=<NPCName>Suki</>’s too active for a desk job.
10_Text=Ah, here comes Monday…
68_Text=Ah, she doesn’t mind anyway. Besides, it’s not like I use it every day… Maybe three times a year, tops!
62_Text=Ah, she doesn’t mind anyway. Besides, it’s not like I use it every day…//<portrait=surprised>Maybe three times a year, tops!
118_Text=Ah, the beach looks so clean. But I hope we don’t forget there’s still so much trash in the sea and the river.//We still need to change our lifestyle to stop this from happening.
82_Text=Ah… I kinda miss the snow already.
21_Text=Another good hobby is having meaningful discussions. Pick each other’s brains and share views…//You learn a lot of new things that way.
169_Text=Are you heading to the cavern?
84_Text=Are you planning on planting pineapples this Summer?
75_Text=As soon as <NPCName>Suki</> was back in town, our parents decided to retire early. They didn’t think the inn had enough work for four people.
7_Text=Being alone isn't always bad.//Personal space is rarely a thing when you grow up with someone <Italic>sparkly</> like <NPCName>Suki</>.
104_Text=Brrrr. It’s starting to get cold. I’ll have to do my reading inside soon.
43_Text=Can you imagine what life is like on Mars? I would love to go there and see it for myself.
181_Text=Can you smell the salt? Hmmm…
172_Text=Could be nothing, but who knows…//<portrait=normal>I might see something one of these days and decide for myself.
166_Text=Did you hear about the light phenomenon over on Turtle Island?
162_Text=Did you just have your morning walk too? I like how quiet it is in the morning.//Right before everyone wakes up. It’s just you and the birds.
93_Text=Do you know what Summer is good for? Spending time outside, eating tons of minced jackfruit pies, going to the beach – all that good stuff.
144_Text=Do you need a room?
152_Text=Don’t even try to tell <NPCName>Suki</> to sit still and work the desk for too long.//She won’t be able to do it.
95_Text=Easily the best thing about Summer is the abundance of jackfruit. I can make as many minced jackfruit pies as I want!
119_Text=Everyone did such a great job yesterday.
103_Text=Fall is so pretty, isn’t it? Now, if only it were a bit warmer…
168_Text=Fancy meeting you here!//<portrait=happy>I only ever see <NPCName>Ben</> and sometimes a monkey or two.
32_Text=Ha ha! It IS Monday. Too early to tell, huh?
74_Text=He sure is dedicated. <NPCName>Rafael</> visits <NPCName>Valentina</> on weekends and makes sure she’s all right.
55_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$player</>! What brings you here?
50_Text=Here’s a way to improve the community. The library should get more books about extraterrestrial life.
170_Text=Hmm… I think I’ll walk through town on my way home.//<portrait=normal>I have to make a quick stop at the library.
52_Text=How are you doing today, <PlayerName>$player</>?
38_Text=How’s your week been so far?
33_Text=I <Italic>did</> take some questionable courses in university.//<portrait=normal>But actually, those classes were the most fun. Looking back, that should have been my major.
109_Text=I asked my parents <Italic>and</> <NPCName>Suki</> if we could just close the inn for Winter, but they shot me down. Many times.//<portrait=annoyed>You think a broken air conditioner is a problem, wait until you deal with a guest complaining about the heater.
60_Text=I could be wrong… But I’m keeping my mind open.//<portrait=happy>Let’s see where it gets me.
131_Text=I couldn’t get to sleep until 1 am. I might have had too much caffeine yesterday.
165_Text=I didn’t know then that she was going to install drills around the island…//She was always very secretive. Never really looked like a tourist, either.
167_Text=I do like to read about odd phenomena all over the world.//<portrait=surprised>It fascinates me.
67_Text=I don’t see why I should buy my own camera.//I don't want to spend money on a camera when I can just borrow <NPCName>Macy</>’s.
42_Text=I don’t think we’re alone in the universe…//I’ve read some interesting theories.
90_Text=I don’t usually love the color pink, but I make an exception for cherry blossoms.//<portrait=happy>They’re just so beautiful.
130_Text=I had my green tea too late today.//<portrait=sad>I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight…
124_Text=I have to start working on a new marketing plan for Winter…
163_Text=I have to work today. I’m going straight to the inn after this.
140_Text=I hope it doesn’t turn into a storm like last time! We can’t afford to install a new heating system every Winter.
146_Text=I just updated our point-of-sale system. Let’s see how it works!
132_Text=I like dinner parties, but sometimes people can wear you out…
115_Text=I love seeing all these pretty Summer flowers around the island.//Diversity is beautiful, isn’t it?
100_Text=I love seeing the daisies popping up everywhere. It practically screams Summer.
123_Text=I love walking through the leaves. Do you ever do that?
155_Text=I meant, like, <NPCName>Luke</>  for instance. He could rent some space over there, by the door, and sell electronics.
105_Text=I miss Summer already…
176_Text=I read this book back at university… You should read it.//Professor Kiep has interesting theories about ET intelligence.
137_Text=I see you don’t mind it either…
121_Text=I should head to <NPCName>Ben’s</> next week. I need to catch him before he leaves for his trip.
9_Text=I sometimes wonder if running this inn is the right move for me.//I don't know...
154_Text=I think it may be a good idea to rent out sales space in the lobby.
99_Text=I wish <NPCName>Noah</> would come to the forest with me to help with my research, but he just wants to stay at the beach all day.
120_Text=I wonder if <NPCName>Ben</> has left on his trip yet…
179_Text=I wonder if they have any new books. I’ve been reading the same old books.
114_Text=If I ever leave this town, the festival would be one thing that I’d miss.
141_Text=If this Winter gets any colder, I’m afraid we’ll start losing business.
41_Text=If you’re not a caffeine person, a quick jog does the trick when you need to wake up.
12_Text=Is everything okay?
1_Text=Is that… Is that you, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=surprised>Wow! I almost didn’t recognize you in that getup.//<portrait=normal>Oh, so you’re the one moving into the lot, huh? That would explain the outfit.
112_Text=It can be a bit of a bummer to have a birthday so close to a festival, but our parents made sure we didn’t feel left out when we were younger.
72_Text=It’s a bit hard to sort through them all. If only there were a filter that showed just certain publications…
64_Text=It’s all <NPCName>Suki</>’s idea, to tell you the truth.//<portrait=normal>If it were up to me, I’d just leave the sheets beige.
97_Text=It’s easier to do my…research in Summer.//I can stay out longer to see if there’s anything strange on the island.
98_Text=It’s nice to see the community come together. It’s one of the reasons I love the Beach Cleanup Festival.
27_Text=It’s nice to see you here, <PlayerName>$player</>.
14_Text=It’s pretty fair, I think… Right?
19_Text=It’s pretty fair, I think… Right?//<portrait=sad>Maybe she doesn’t see it that way...//<portrait=sad>I mean, she does a lot of the cooking, but she doesn’t seem to mind. So don’t you think that’s fair?
106_Text=It’s so chilly…
173_Text=It’s such a different vibe in here compared to the inn.
102_Text=It’s the last week of Fall, and do you know what that means?//<portrait=annoyed>We have to prepare the inn for Winter. Ugh.
110_Text=I’d close the inn all Winter if it were up to me. But we can’t. Something about being the only inn in town. Ugh.
182_Text=I’ll head back soon. I just wanna get some new books.
94_Text=I’ll read anywhere, but there’s something about reading outside in the Summer sun that’s more relaxing.
147_Text=I’m a little busy right now…
96_Text=I’m excited about the Beach Cleanup Festival later this season. Are you?
88_Text=I’m glad I made it through another Winter.//<portrait=happy>Now I can look forward to Summer!
143_Text=I’m going to put all the extra blankets up front. In case any of our guests need one.
148_Text=I’m gonna get ready for bed, then read for a bit…
89_Text=I’m just counting the days until Summer is here, <PlayerName>$player</>.
111_Text=I’m looking forward to the New Year’s Eve Festival. It’s so fun and festive, but it also means Winter is officially over.
180_Text=I’m not being fair. It’s my own fault because I like to reread the same old books.
47_Text=I’m not doing anything today.//<portrait=happy>Fun, fun!
24_Text=I’m pretty much free today. I usually pay the bills on Wednesdays…//That way, I can make sure that we don’t double pay.
86_Text=I’m so happy Spring is almost over, because it means Summer is right around the corner. I love the longer days!
34_Text=I’m sure I’m not the first person who picked the wrong major, though.//<portrait=annoyed>By the way, who told you all this?
28_Text=I’ve got a few tips for you. I’ve lived by the beach my whole life, so I know that sometimes you can find rare seashells.//<portrait=happy>I’m talking rare as in expensive!
49_Text=Just keep in mind that if you like collecting seashells, keep an eye out for them at the beach!
151_Text=Just trying to respond to online reviewers. Then I’m going to manage our social media marketing.
91_Text=Living with <NPCName>Suki</> in Spring has pros and cons.//<portrait=happy>Pro: I barely have to clean anything, because she goes on a cleaning spree.//<portrait=annoyed>Con: She’s even more overbearing and annoying than usual.
157_Text=Looking for one of our guests, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=happy>You don’t need my permission. Go ahead and find them.
116_Text=Make sure to use enough sunscreen for the beach cleanup tomorrow, <PlayerName>$player</>. We’ll be in the sun the whole day.
136_Text=Meh… A little rain is fine with me…
65_Text=Morning jogs can be fun, especially with a partner.//Don’t brush it off just yet. Give it a try! 
171_Text=My granddad told me that his friend saw a bright green light deep in the forest. He was pretty sure it was an alien spaceship.
30_Text=Neither <NPCName>Suki</> nor I knew what to do when we first started running Coral Inn. Ha ha. But yeah, it takes a lot to run an inn.//I’m sure it’s nothing compared to running a farm, though.
174_Special=No route where she goes to the forest area
180_Special=No route where she goes to the library
128_Text=Nope! I’m not doing that. Thankfully, he changed his mind.
3_Text=Oh, hello there. It's good to see you here.
81_Text=Oh, you didn’t find any, you said?//<portrait=normal>Animals might have eaten them already. But have you tried by the river in the forest?
83_Text=On my morning walk the other day, I saw people gathering bamboo shoots near the lake.//You should check it out.
160_Text=Once you get to know them better, maybe they’ll let you in their room.
20_Text=One of my hobbies is definitely reading!//What about you? What do you like to do in your spare time?
156_Text=Or – oh! The vineyard! They could sell wine here.
26_Text=Our kitchen is free to use! It’s included in the room rate.//<portrait=normal>Guests can use our kitchen and anything we put out in the lobby.//But you knew that. You stayed in our inn that summer.
6_Text=People like to dismiss things they can't see.//What's the fun in that?
139_Text=Quite a storm, isn’t it?
2_Text=Right. It’s not just the town, you know. The inn isn’t as busy as it used to be.//Hopefully, with you moving in…it’s a sign of something good.
178_Text=Shhh… You need to whisper! Or <NPCName>Millie</> will kick us both out!
174_Text=Some people have claimed to see a figure over the lake…//<portrait=happy>The elders call it the Goddess…
150_Text=Someone on the internet named Sarahhh with three H’s said that she loved the inn! And couldn’t wait to come back.
63_Text=Sometimes we dye our sheets different colors to brighten things up…
53_Text=Sometimes we dye our sheets different colors to brighten things up…//That way they look new.
159_Text=Sorry, I can’t open any locked doors for you. If it’s closed, there’s nothing I can help you with.//I guess my best advice is just to talk to the guest.
92_Text=Summer, finally! Now I can read outside as much as I want.
8_Text=Sure, energetic works too.
158_Text=Thanks for asking, though.
57_Text=The 10-year-old me was much more adventurous than adult me.//Now, I like to keep things plain and beige.
77_Text=The cherry blossoms look beautiful this time of year.
129_Text=The inn got a bad review last year. A couple complained about the broken heater in their room. So we have to make sure it’s working this year.//<portrait=sad>It could be bad for business otherwise.
17_Text=The inn usually gets more guests during festivals.
71_Text=The internet has way too many poorly sourced articles about flying saucers… Hmm…
122_Text=The leaves were crunchy on my walk this morning.
16_Text=The mayor is always watching the economy.//He gets excited about the analysis when we go over what we learned in the past season and all that.
108_Text=The only good thing about Winter is it’s when our birthday is.//<portrait=annoyed>Everything else I can do without.
113_Text=The snow is pretty, I’ll admit. But does it have to be so cold?
58_Text=The universe is so big, don’t you think?//<portrait=happy>I mean, look at Earth. We haven’t even fully explored it yet.
48_Text=There is this magnificent rainbow seashell one time that <NPCName>Valentina</> brought home.//<portrait=surprised>Have you seen one of those?//<portrait=normal>Oh, it was so beautiful. I’m pretty sure it would sell for a lot too.
117_Text=There’s a swimming contest too.//<NPCName>Sunny’s</> going to be the winner again, I bet. Ha ha!
87_Text=There’s something cheerful about the flowers in Spring. I know <NPCName>Suki</> can’t get enough of them.
125_Text=They give out free mooncakes at the Harvest Festival.//They’re <NPCName>Betty’s</>, so they’re good, for sure!
85_Text=They’re all right. I was just curious…//But I heard that <NPCName>Joko</> loves pineapples. One time he gave us some as a souvenir from his trip.
25_Text=Think of it this way, the more people that are allowed access to paying the bills, the more chance that there’ll be mistakes – overpaying, missing invoices, all that.
49F006F647BE81738C2441802E0ABF3E=This is going to be text for Gong
E66A7A9B466483F0C4E7C9A07ED2218A=This is going to be text for Grog

7918DA7D4A269F55E0DA68A2F6565F6A=This is going to be text from Chieftain
80_Text=This time of year, you can find fresh wasabi by the river…
135_Text=This weather makes me sleepy…
52_Text=Uh-uh. Not just me… Let me see… Hmm… <NPCName>Noah</>…and, um…
15_Text=We keep track of guests daily and run an analysis at the end of the season.//That's how we're taught by our parents.
149_Text=We offer wine in the evening and a fresh fruit bar in the morning…//<portrait=happy>I think that should be enough, don’t you?
59_Text=We seem to keep finding new species of animals… On land, in the ocean! Ancient fish. Gosh.//<portrait=surprised>What else is out there?!//<portrait=happy>Could there be life on other planets? I think so.
56_Text=When we were kids, <NPCName>Suki</> and I used to dress the same to confuse our friends. It didn’t always work, because we aren’t identical, but when it did, it was great!
107_Text=When will this Winter be over?
177_Text=Who orders these books, I wonder? I think they have too many cookbooks.
101_Text=Why can’t Summer be longer? I haven’t finished my reading yet!
29_Text=Yeah! There are plenty of rare, pretty shells on our beach. Kids love collecting them.
161_Text=Yes? I don’t want to be rude, but I’m a little too tired to chat…
66_Text=You could say that about pretty much anything, though, huh?
76_Text=You see, my sis used to live in Labuan Bajo, the little town on the other side of Coral Island, with her ex-husband. But since the, errr, separation, she moved back here.
55_Special=firstDialogueOnly
142_Text=…I hope it doesn’t get to that point.
51_Text=…Just saying. Some people are interested in that stuff, you know.
175_Text=…What if…//<portrait=annoyed>What if she’s not a spiritual figure like the locals believe, but actually from another planet?!
74_Text=*<NpcName>Anne</> is mumbling to herself*…Milk, eggs…
55_Text=A little rain wouldn’t hurt, I don’t think.
2_Text=A quick word of advice from your new neighbor.//Be patient! Since last year, those darn crops aren’t growing like they used to.
44_Text=Ah, that reminds me! I need to ask <NpcName>Paul</> to bring in some extra blankets from the shed now that it’s getting colder.//I’ll just ask him tomorrow.
63_Text=All right, it may not be a storm, but it’s so cold out, it might as well be. Some animals are in their hideouts. They need to keep warm, you know…//<portrait=normal>Just like us.
26_Text=As a mom, I worry all the time. I don’t like <NpcName>Zoe</> walking too far, especially on rainy days.
67_Text=As soon as I get home, I’ll realize I forgot to buy something.//<portrait=concerned>It’s pretty annoying, if you ask me.
32_Text=But it’s a bit outside our budget right now… Oh well! It’s not the end of the world.
1_Text=Good day, stranger!//Oh, you just moved onto the farm? Welcome to the community.//<portrait=normal>My name is <NPCName>Anne</>.
19_Text=Having a busy Friday, <PlayerName>$player</>?
17_Text=Having a busy Thursday, <PlayerName>$player</>?
36_Text=Hmm… It would be interesting to observe wildlife behavior in different settings.
66_Text=I always seem to forget something. I wonder if that’s a grocery thing.
69_Text=I can’t ask <NpcName>Paul</> to get groceries. He’d just scavenge some vegetables from the lake or something and bring them home.
38_Text=I can’t do my shopping on the weekend. I’d have to take <NpcName>Zoe</> with me, and she’d want to buy all the cookies.
21_Text=I don’t know how safe it is to live in the forest, especially with small children.
70_Text=I mean, there’s nothing wrong with wild vegetables.//<portrait=annoyed>But they’re different.
50_Text=I might open up the windows tonight and let the sound of rain come in.
57_Text=I need to always be ready in case we need to run out and film.
7_Text=I need to drop off my recycling before going to the supermarket tomorrow.
43_Text=I think I saw a couple of beavers swimming at the lake on my way here. Did you see them too?
23_Text=I think I’ll make some gnocchi and hummus for dinner.//Make a little extra for tomorrow too.
64_Text=I wonder how long the snow will last. I’m not complaining, though.
75_Text=I wonder if I should get a couple bottles of milk instead of just one. But I don’t want it to go bad if nobody drinks it.//That would be such a waste.
9_Text=I wonder where we’ll put our recycling once the dumpster is full…
65_Text=I'm here to pick up some groceries for the week. Hopefully, I’ll get everything I need.
62_Text=If we were living in the middle of the forest, what would we do during a snowstorm like this?
12_Text=If you grow soybeans, you can use them to make tempeh.//I’m sure you already know that.
27_Text=If you look closely in the trees, you may notice some birds’ nests around the island.//<portrait=normal><NpcName>Zoe</> gets really excited when she spots one.
71_Text=If you need a carrot, you can’t just come home with kale…//Or a fig.//You can’t substitute just anything for anything.
34_Text=In this job, I believe that patience is the key.
33_Text=It takes us days and sometimes weeks to capture the best wildlife footage.
41_Text=It’s <NpcName>Paul</>’s birthday this weekend. To be honest, I haven’t gotten anything for him yet.//I hope there’s still time.
53_Text=It’s Summer after all. What else can you expect?
25_Text=It’s great that <NpcName>Paul</> and I can observe wildlife around the clock, since we’re surrounded by nature.//But I also like that the woodland is so close to the school.
52_Text=It’s so humid today. Not even the rain helps break this humidity.
54_Text=It’s so humid today.//Oh gosh!
6_Text=It’s too far from the town and whatnot. Oh well!
14_Text=I’m trying to find time to edit all this video footage before the deadline.
78_Text=Just try not to step on anything, will you?
58_Text=Keep your jacket on, <PlayerName>$player</>! It’s freezing out.
29_Text=Let me get this straight – you quit your job and moved to Coral Island to become a farmer?
51_Text=Let’s just hope there’s not a storm tonight.
10_Text=Not everybody has one of those fancy compact recycling machines.//<portrait=concerned>Ah, you know, the little machine that you put in your yard? Don’t you have one?

117_Text=Yay! Its snowing!
161_Text=Yeah it looks the same. Ha ha ha.. Thats the only shape I know how to make!
48_Text=You have to make sure to water your crops everyday because they wont grow if you dont.
27_Text=You own the farm near the forest right?
118_Text=Your boots are dirty
150_Text=Youre not supposed to touch the fossil..
134_Text=aaahh.. where is my dad..
20_Text=umm... hi Player
105_Text=zzz...
139_Text=*mumble to self* Is there a leak in my caravan?
154_Text=<NpcName>Emily</> cuts my hair. She oozes talent, doesn’t she?//But that's not why I'm here.//I'm here to deliver some stuff for <NpcName>Sam</>.
127_Text=<NpcName>Funbucket</> is my boy!
171_Text=<NpcName>Funbucket</> is one happy fella.
40_Text=<NpcName>Funbucket</> is one happy fella.//<portrait=normal>I was gathering fodder for <NpcName>Jack</> when I first saw him running around the yard.
126_Text=<NpcName>Jack</> showed me a picture of <NpcName>Funbucket</> on the animal day, and he looked like he was having the time of his life.//He just walked and walked. Saying hi to everybody... A kind-hearted fellow, that one.
152_Text=<NpcName>Suki</> taught me how to make green smoothies.//<portrait=annoyed>Want some?
80_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, don’t you just love all the flowers? So much life around us. Let’s stay still for a moment and absorb it all.
102_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, let’s take a deep breath of that chilly Winter.//Whoa…THAT IS COLD.//I think my brain froze a little there.
110_Text=A friend was camping on someone's lawn one time, and he may have been kicked out.
75_Text=A friend was camping on someone’s lawn one time, and he may have been kicked out.
125_Text=Aaa... Yeah, and other people too.
118_Text=Aaaaahhhhhhh.... Say it with me. AAAAAAAAAhhhhh--
34_Text=Ah, <PlayerName>$player</>... <PlayerName>$player</>... Here I am.. And there you are...
99_Text=Ah, Fall. It’s just so beautiful, isn’t it? All the beautiful colors…//Makes me want to head out of town and travel for a while.
84_Text=Ah, Spring. Everything is just so beautiful, isn’t it?
86_Text=Ah, Summer. Enjoy the heat and humidity, <PlayerName>$player</>. Isn’t it great?
172_Text=Ah, picking up some work, friend. <NpcName>Jack</> hires me part-time to gather extra fodder.
97_Text=Ah, too bad I’m leaving soon.//I see all these mushrooms popping up, and I won’t be able to gather any on my trip.
149_Text=All I need in life is green tea and some bananas.//<portrait=happy>They're all I need to spread positivity.
106_Text=All the snow covering the ground… That’s Winter, mate.//It’s one of the reasons I always come back here for Winter. Who wants to miss out on this beauty?//But also, I don’t have a long-term parking permit anywhere else.
29_Text=Also, there was this strong odor after wearing it awhile...//<portrait=happy>I took that as my feet telling me no.
93_Text=Am I sad the leaves are falling?//A little bit, but I know they’ll grow back.
83_Text=Are you allergic to pollen, mate? The doctor’s been sneezing constantly, and I feel really bad for him.//The doctor with the short hair, not the one with the cool <Italic>green</> hair.
129_Text=At this time of year, there should be plenty around the island.
142_Text=Beanie sure helps with the snow...
170_Text=Being around animals makes me happy—especially this cute little duck.
37_Text=Coconut, shells, shiny shells, dull shells... All kinds of shells.
128_Text=Did you get any truffles today? I looked around for it this morning and only found a couple.
82_Text=Do you have any of those fancy-schmancy mushroom logs, <PlayerName>$player</>? They’re pretty cool, but I like to gather mushrooms from the wild. There are plenty around the island right now.
42_Text=Do you have any pets, <PlayerName>$player</>?
156_Text=Dry rice can last 4-5 years, and they're filling.//So I try to keep a couple of boxes in my van.
58_Text=Eerrrr... Sorry. This is awkward...
122_Text=Fall’s been great, but I gotta head out. Change of scenery and all that.//I’m leaving next week.
111_Text=Fine fine. Who am I kidding... It was me.//I was that friend who got kicked out.//<portrait=normal>In my defense, it looked like an overgrown cemetery.
76_Text=Fine, fine. Who am I kidding? It was me.//I was the friend who got kicked out.//<portrait=normal>In my defense, it looked like an overgrown cemetery.
131_Text=Got the blues, I think... Hmm...
124_Text=Great to be back. I should go to see <NpcName>Suki</>.
70_Text=Happy New Year!
162_Text=He was afraid my caravan might damage the festival field.//<portrait=normal>I understand... All cool...
155_Text=Hmm... I thought about settling down and opening a store like this...//<portrait=concerned>But between you and me, it isn't really my style though...
157_Text=Hmm... Should I buy bread or a tortilla?
119_Text=I bet you're feeling better already.
147_Text=I can sell you my crystals for some extra good vibes in your cabin.//Just give me the right price...//<portrait=happy>If the crystals agree, they are yours...
66_Text=I can try, though. But I'm sure I would fail.
108_Text=I collected some cool things on my trip. Why don’t you check them out during the Winter Fair? I’ll have a booth there.
39_Text=I got a duck from <NpcName>Jack</>, but he's boarding him for me.//<portrait=normal>I think it's best that <NpcName>Funbucket</> lives with his friends than to travel with me. You know...
22_Text=I grow flowers near the caravan sometimes, to kinda help the bee population.//I also sell some of the flowers that I harvest.
35_Text=I have been wandering around, thinking to myself...//<portrait=happy>Who am I destined to meet on this joyful day...
87_Text=I hear people complaining about the heat, but nah, mate. Just enjoy the heat. Absorb all the good sun.
165_Text=I heard this area isn’t on the town’s original map… The locals built it up years ago because they needed higher ground for the lighthouse.
169_Text=I like to meditate here. I think it might be my favorite spot…a bit hidden.//Just me and the ocean waves.
33_Text=I like to think that it was meant to be Moon-day. The day of brightness.//<portrait=happy>It was the beginning of the week, which means the day of rejoicing...//Are we getting each other here?
81_Text=I love Spring. I can hear the birds chirping again.//<portrait=happy>Like me! I’m <Italic>chirping</> again. I’M A BIRD!
100_Text=I need to start preparing for my trip next week.//<portrait=normal>Let’s see, I need to stock up on mushrooms, green tea…
15_Text=I pick up items for <NpcName>Sam</> sometimes.//You know, little things like seeds and stuff... He pays well for delivery.
67_Text=I plant flowers around my caravan sometimes to attract more bees to this island...
3_Text=I sell anything. Some of them are rare, you see...//But I don't have a specific category, per se.
137_Text=I should go back. I'm so sleepy!
146_Text=I think I'm just gonna chill here today.
38_Text=I think about my duck sometimes...//<portrait=happy>What is going through his mind and all that.//...You know, the usual.
28_Text=I tried boots before. But they just didn't feel right on my feet.
20_Text=I usually stay in my van all day on the weekend.//Cleaning up.
161_Text=I wanted to park here, but Mayor <NpcName>Connor</> never issued me a permit. Hah!
6_Text=I would definitely sell them to you if I can find it. Check often!
117_Text=I would rest and surround myself with healing quartz if I were you.//Just inhaling positivity until my body is overwhelmed by joy.
61_Text=I'd be careful in there if I were you. I took my quartz inside the cavern one time... You know, to recharge the vibe...//And I came out with a couple of bats on my hair... Nesting.
121_Text=I'll be back in the Winter, and I'll bring a bunch of new stuff to sell.
26_Text=I'm a wanderer. I don't settle in one spot.//It's just not who I am.
45_Text=I'm a wanderer. I don't settle in one spot.//It's just not who I am.//<portrait=annoyed>Except for today, I guess.
64_Text=I'm gonna take a chill day today, <PlayerName>$player</>. See if I can make some money here instead.
120_Text=I'm heading out about two weeks from now. Need a change in scenery, you know?
130_Text=I'm not feeling too jolly today.
163_Text=I'm saving all these wild fruits for my lunch tomorrow.
57_Text=I've been trying to pick up a new hobby lately. I do carpentry but not too often... What do you like to do in your free time, <NPCName>Luke</>?
113_Text=If they intend to fall, they will fall gracefully.//If they plan to float with humidity, who are we to stop it.
5_Text=If you need rare seeds, rare furniture, or a specific item, I might be your guy.//I might have it in my caravan somewhere.
136_Text=It isn't too bad here during the rain, eh?
151_Text=It isn't too bad living in this thing.//<portrait=happy>The best thing is you can always drive off when you're bored. Hah!
145_Text=It's a nice change to come here after a hot desert music festival.
173_Text=It's an easy job, and I can use the extra money.
69_Text=It's an easy job, and I can use the extra money...
116_Text=It's been a long day, huh? You seem a bit drained.
141_Text=It's much warmer here during the rain than inside my caravan.
132_Text=It's plenty warm inside the caravan. I have a tiny stove that works as a heater as well.
143_Text=It's plenty warm inside the caravan.//I have a tiny stove that works as a heater as well.
158_Text=It's quite a walk to get here, eh? Especially from your place.
92_Text=It’s all right that the grass is a bit patchy, you know? Sometimes nature just needs to do its thing. Doesn’t mean it’s less great.
78_Text=It’s been a long day, huh?//<portrait=annoyed>You seem a bit drained…
104_Text=It’s kinda chilly, you know? Maybe I’ll head to the tavern to warm up before I go to bed.//This whole town is my home, mate. The tavern, this van…your cabin, eh? Heh heh heh!
49_Text=It’s true that they can't speak, but that is not the point. The point is us, <PlayerName>$player</>, we are injected with knowledge and stuff. It makes us feel okay to judge one another.
79_Text=I’d rest and surround myself with healing quartz if I were you.//<portrait=happy>Just inhaling positivity until my body is overwhelmed by joy.
107_Text=I’ve got a few things to sell at the Winter Fair. Why don’t you stop by and see what I’ve got?
10_Text=Look at me… I don't have a lot of money, but I'm happy...//<portrait=happy>I've got all I need.
72_Text=Lots of mushrooms grow on this island, mate.//Hmm… Hang on… Let me list them for you! Shiitake, black trumpet, truffle…
2_Text=May our paths cross again.
50_Text=My coffee? Yes, I had it this morning. Why?
53_Text=My friend! <PlayerName>$player</>! How are we doing today? The wind is kind to me today, my friend. I can not ask for a better Thursday.
65_Text=My friend! <PlayerName>$player</>! How are we doing today?//The wind is kind to me today, my friend. I can not ask for a better Sunday.
112_Text=My hair is fine the way it is. We wanna go natural on it.
101_Text=My trip was great, <PlayerName>$player</>. It’s one of the upsides of living in a van – that’s what I call my caravan sometimes. I can take my home anywhere!//But I’m ready to chill here for a while.
59_Text=Names are all jumbled up... Way too many people living here, to remember...... <PlayerName>$player</>, <PlayerName>$player</>. <PlayerName>$player</>...
123_Text=Nice to see you again, <PlayerName>$player</>!
14_Text=No need to be so confused, my friend. It's a hard one.//<portrait=normal>Identity is never easy to answer.
23_Text=Not always, sometimes, I grow herbs.//<portrait=normal>I don't buy the seeds, just whatever I can find around the island.
17_Text=Not even room to think, honestly... Sometimes, I find myself sitting at the beach and...//<portrait=surprised>BAM! Suddenly it's night time.
88_Text=Nothing really changes much for me in Summer. It’s pretty chill.//Well, actually, it’s pretty hot, but you know what I mean.
32_Text=Oh Tuesday... Tuesday. Tomorrow is probably Wednesday...//<portrait=concerned>It's all <Italic>so</> predictable. This world needs a twist and a push of creativity.//<portrait=happy>And you know what? Yesterday was indeed Monday.
47_Text=Oh yeah... Those things are yummy as heck.
63_Text=Oh yeah... Those things are yummy as heck... But nothing beats fresh bananas, though.
1_Text=Ommm…//Oh… A new face. Feeling really good vibes from you, mate.
159_Text=One of these days, I'm going to start writing about crystals.
11_Text=People throw perfectly good items. It's sad to just see them as junk, so I rehome them.
150_Text=Rose quartz gives all the love...//<portrait=normal>We get love. We give love... You know what I mean...
43_Text=Sandals are the way to go. I'm a no cage kind of guy.//Not on animals, not on my feet.
114_Text=Sandals are the way to go. I'm a no-cage kind of guy. Not on animals, not on my feet.
96_Text=See those red and orange leaves? It means I’m gonna leave town soon.//<portrait=happy>Don’t worry, mate, I’m coming back. So don’t miss me too much.
12_Text=Sell them at a price, yes... Something like that.//You got the idea... Nice!
134_Text=So much rain lately... Beez...
68_Text=Sometimes I visit the ranch to help out with the animals. Also, <NpcName>Jack</> hires me part-time to gather extra fodder.
90_Text=Sometimes it gets too hot in the caravan, but then I can just head to the tavern or stand in front of <NPCName>Sam’s</> fresh groceries section to cool off.
55_Text=Sometimes time goes fast, and sometimes it goes really slow. Like really really slow...
8_Text=Sometimes we just need to take a step back and pay attention to our surroundings.
85_Text=Spring mushrooms taste different from Fall mushrooms. Both are delicious, though.
94_Text=Take a deep breath, <PlayerName>$player</>. In…and out… Fill your lungs with that crisp Fall air. Nice, right?
95_Text=The Fall air always makes me want to travel.
16_Text=The beach is the perfect place to forget about life.//<portrait=happy>It fills your brain with waves, birds singing... There is no room for any other thing.
144_Text=The space isn't that big, so there isn't much to heat up.//<portrait=happy>But if I get too cold, I walk over to the tavern and chill the night out.
133_Text=The space isn't that big, so there isn't much to heat up.//But if I get too cold, I walk over to the tavern and chill the night out.
148_Text=The stars are watching us down here, <PlayerName>$player</>...//They are writing us letters, stories that we can only see in our dreams.
36_Text=There are many things that you can collect at the beach. 
73_Text=There’s that tiny red one, the poisonous kind.//<portrait=normal>You know, you probably shouldn’t eat it, though…//<portrait=happy>Just to be safe, give them to me.
164_Text=They might still have some, near the inn! Go, grab 'em!
7_Text=This island is breathtaking.
56_Text=This time thing isn't for me, my friend. I learned early in life that I am cruising on a different altitude.
48_Text=Trees are a beautiful force of nature. They are who they are and never judge...
168_Text=Trying to get away from the town, huh? You and me both.//What a view.
13_Text=Umm... Are you a folk type of person? Or more of a mate type?
21_Text=Um… Cleaning up stuff. You know. This and that.//<portrait=annoyed>There’s a lot to clean.
60_Text=Visiting the cavern, <PlayerName>$player</>?
153_Text=Welcome to my house!
31_Text=Well, the brakes are a little funny sometimes...//<portrait=happy>You gotta kick it real deep, but hey! Aside from that, it rides okay.
167_Text=Well, well, well… Look who’s here…
98_Text=What am I doing on my trip? Oh, this and that.//<portrait=happy>Mostly, I just need to stretch my legs, if you catch my drift.
77_Text=What are you planting on your farm, <PlayerName>$player</>?
103_Text=What’s the point of complaining about the cold air? It is what it is, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Besides, look at all that beautiful snow.
41_Text=When my store is quiet like this, I think about my duck sometimes...//He lives at the barn over there.
138_Text=Why is it raining so hard lately... Beez...
89_Text=Woo! It’s getting hot, isn’t it? But no sweat. We just gotta take more showers, eh?//<portrait=happy>Get it? No sweat?
166_Text=Would you believe me if I told you I learned that in my dreams?
30_Text=Yeah, the caravan works.
27_Text=Yes... I have always been a wanderer...//<portrait=normal>Since the age of 3, according to my mom.
160_Text=You can mark my word on that! I think it's about time... You know what I mean?
4_Text=You can say that my category is...rare?//<portrait=happy>Maybe...
9_Text=You don't need a lot of money to be happy, <PlayerName>$player</>.
71_Text=You got a trumpet to blow there, <PlayerName>$player</>?
91_Text=You hear that Summer music, <PlayerName>$player</>? Pretty awesome, isn’t it?
46_Text=You heard of this thing. Um... Tempeh?
62_Text=You heard of this thing.. Um... Tempeh?
115_Text=You know what I'm saying, <PlayerName>$player</>? I'm free to see whenever I want to see my toes dancing. Can we say the same about you, though?
44_Text=You know what I'm saying, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=happy>Whenever I want, I'm free to see my toes dancing... Now that's something.
105_Text=You know, once I’m all snuggled up in bed, I don’t really notice the temperature.//It’s kinda nice, actually, to sleep when it’s freezing cold out… As long as I don’t freeze, that’s all I’m asking.
109_Text=You seem like the chill farmer type. Not the "get-off-my-lawn" kind.//<portrait=normal>You know what I'm talking about?
74_Text=You seem like the chill farmer type. Not the get-off-my-lawn kind.//<portrait=normal>Know what I mean?
76_Text=*cough* *cough*
15_Text=<NpcName>Eva</> and I have a lot in common. We both love red velvet cake…//<portrait=normal>but who doesn’t?
94_Text=<NpcName>Millie</> is the only one building a house in this area… I wonder why it isn’t more popular.
44_Text=<NpcName>Noah</> needs to be more careful putting dishes away.//We almost lost a stack of cups the other day when he crammed the cabinet too full.
32_Text=<NpcName>Noah</> says I spoil the cats…//<portrait=happy2>I’m starting to think he might have a point… Heh heh.
9_Text=<NpcName>Pablo</> helps me fix the broken bird feeders.//<portrait=happy>He and his brother are very handy.
20_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>?
50_Text=A community garden reminds me of the old days, when we used to share everything we had.
11_Text=After all, you moved here, didn’t you?
63_Text=Ah, I’ve already asked you about that, haven’t I? As much as I’d like to, I can’t blame it on old age… I’ve always been this way. Heh heh.
108_Text=Ah, this one still seems to have plenty.//<portrait=concerned>Maybe <NPCName>Suki</> just refilled them.
59_Text=Am I really going to complain about the heat?//<portrait=annoyed>No. I will not.
27_Text=Are you eating enough?
93_Text=Are you heading to the beach?
111_Text=Are you stopping by the tavern?
48_Text=Be careful of crows. They may seem harmless, but they like to steal crops.
30_Text=Can’t answer that one?//<portrait=happy>You are still very young. I guess you haven’t had many “old days” just yet.
6_Text=Do you know that turtles often eat trash? They think it’s plankton or floating seaweed. But they can’t digest it.//<portrait=sad>Eating trash really harms animals.
7_Text=For old folks like me, Monday is just another day.
64_Text=Forgetfulness has become a part of my identity lately. Heh heh
100_Text=Have you gone diving lately, <PlayerName>$player</>?
96_Text=He and <NpcName>Noah</> are picky when it comes to yogurt.//<portrait=sad>No matter what I put in it, they don’t seem to like it.
102_Text=Hmmm…
41_Text=Hmm… I’m going to try to make a batch of popiah sometime this week.
1_Text=How lovely to see a new face around here!//You can call me <NPCName>Betty</>, dear.
68_Text=I can never get tired of the Fall breeze.//Ah… This is my favorite time of year…
67_Text=I can’t be outside in the heat for too long. The heat can be...a bit much.
39_Text=I do that every week.//<portrait=normal>I usually volunteer my time at the school, just like my daughter-in-law, <NpcName>Erika</>.
23_Text=I don’t bother them anymore.//I think they’ve got the tavern handled.
8_Text=I don’t mind refilling the bird feeders around town.//I have a lot of time on my hands.
89_Text=I have to wear extra socks at night.
43_Text=I know we have some eggplants, but you can’t use eggplants to make popiah.//<portrait=annoyed>It won’t be popiah without carrots.
45_Text=I like a lot of things about this town.//<portrait=happy>The lake, the wildlife, <NpcName>Jim</>’s smoked salmon… Heh heh.
29_Text=I miss the old days sometimes, don’t you?
101_Text=I must walk extra carefully around here.//One fall and I could break my hip.
71_Text=I sometimes wish <NpcName>Frank</> would give me some grandchildren! But I respect their decision.
103_Text=I spent a lot of time here, at the beach with my late husband.//I don’t care much for money.//Quality time with family is what leaves the deepest imprint in our hearts.
26_Text=I still bake, just not as much as I used to.//<portrait=concerned>I just don’t have the same energy…
97_Text=I suppose I can’t blame them.//They’re still young and think they’ll be healthy forever.//<portrait=normal>But we need to take care of our bodies so our bodies take care of us, yes?
24_Text=I talk about a lot of things at school.//<portrait=normal>How to recycle properly, for instance.//It may seem simple, but I want the kids to learn the right way early on.
55_Text=I was talking about the cherry blossom festival. What were you talking about, <PlayerName>$player</>?
42_Text=I wonder how many carrots we have left in the fridge?
85_Text=If I don’t absolutely have to leave the house, I try to stay in when the weather’s like this…
99_Text=If you feel comfortable going in the forest, the area around <NpcName>Kira</>’s cabin is very lush.//<portrait=normal>My late husband used to find plenty of things there.
12_Text=If you have any fruit trees on your farm, don’t chop them down at the end of the season.//Unlike crops that wither, they’ll be ready to produce again in the coming year.
49_Text=If you’re worried, I hear that scarecrows can be effective to scare them off.
86_Text=Is it snowing out?
57_Text=Is something the matter, dear?
60_Text=It is warm…//But warm is good.//<portrait=normal>We need warmth sometimes, yes?//<portrait=annoyed>The humidity, though… Hmm…
19_Text=It’s best to use reusable containers, but when you can’t, remember to try to recycle them, yes?
47_Text=It’s hygienic to clean our food//We don’t want to eat dirt.
40_Text=It’s our responsibility to take care of the planet for future generations.//<portrait=concerned>Don’t you agree?
61_Text=It’s too hot for tulips.//<portrait=annoyed>I think I’ll plant irises instead.
54_Text=I’ll be bringing red velvet cake tomorrow. I suspect there won’t be many desserts.
98_Text=I’m enjoying the view.//<portrait=normal>I was scavenging in the woodlands earlier, and I think I gathered enough for dinner.
107_Text=I’m just here to refill the bird feeder.
58_Text=I’m planting flowers to help the bee population.//In time, I hope we’ll see more bee houses around the island.
95_Text=I’ve been trying to get <NpcName>Frank</> to eat more yogurt.//He’s been eating pancakes all the time lately, and <NpcName>Erika</> doesn’t seem to pay much attention to their diet at home.
69_Text=Keep some lotus in your pantry, <PlayerName>$player</>. You never know when you’ll have a craving for mooncakes.
37_Text=Kids are very perceptive.//They watch everything we do and mimic our actions…//As adults, we must be careful not to set a bad example.
46_Text=Make sure to wash your produce with running water before eating it raw, <PlayerName>$player</>.
109_Text=Mayor <NpcName>Connor</> put me in charge of the town’s decoration and landscaping…//I like doing it, but it’s a lot of work.//<portrait=happy>Thankfully, I have <NpcName>Pablo</> to help.
73_Text=Mooncakes aren’t hard to make. You need lotus, though. Mix it with flour and egg and blend it all together… Try it sometime!
51_Text=My great-grandparents were part of the farming community on this island. They planted while others fished or built.
28_Text=My only advice to you is to keep cooking.//<portrait=happy><NpcName>Frank</> is always on the lookout for new recipes to try.
62_Text=My son <NpcName>Frank</> said you also adopted a new pet?
110_Text=Now that I have a lot of free time on my hands, I can finally give back to the community.
34_Text=Oh, I don’t know. Maybe for cooking? Just a little tip, dear.
52_Text=Peonies are blooming this time of year.
31_Text=Planting bee-friendly flowers on your farm can help boost the bee population.//If you could build some bee houses, too, that would be even better.
92_Text=Please watch your step. I would hate for you to crush these flowers.
70_Text=Raising four children is not easy. Especially when they’re so close in age. It was chaos from the first. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.
3_Text=Remember to reuse what you can and recycle what you can’t, <PlayerName>$player</>.
4_Text=Right, we don’t have any community recycling machines yet.//<portrait=normal>But all in good time.
16_Text=She is such a ray of sunshine.
65_Text=Sunflowers are blooming this time of year.
87_Text=The kids must be out building snowmen by the park.//<portrait=normal>That used to be all my kids’ favorite spot when it snowed. Heh heh.
22_Text=The kids run the tavern on their own.//It may look easy, but running a food business is a lot of work.
88_Text=The snow is giving me cold feet…
74_Text=The weather keeps getting colder. It’s not agreeing with my joints.
105_Text=The wind isn’t agreeing with me.//I should head back soon.
56_Text=There’s a calendar in front of the community center that shows festivals and birthdays.//<portrait=normal>Take a look, it’s very handy.
10_Text=This island has a lot of potential.//It’s nice that people are starting to recognize that.
112_Text=Today I want to focus on the town’s landscaping.
25_Text=We can only hope it’ll stick with them into adulthood.
104_Text=We used to watch the sunsets right there...by the tree.//My sons are around your age, and I always tell them to remember to live…//<portrait=happy>Never let yourself get too busy to go on adventures.
90_Text=What a lovely day!//<portrait=happy>I might bake mooncakes later to enjoy with some evening tea.
106_Text=Where is your wetsuit? It’s perfect diving weather…
91_Text=Why, of course I can bake mooncakes.//I don’t just bake cookies, dear…
66_Text=Will you be planting any at your farm?
53_Text=Will you be planting any at your farm?//<portrait=normal>It’s not too late, you know.
83_Text=Would you wipe your boots at the door, please?
38_Text=Yesterday, I taught about all the different things that damage coral reefs and how to prevent them from dying.
33_Text=You may want to save some of your harvest.//Put something away for later seasons.
81_Text=You should go home and rest, dear…//With this weather, you don’t want to catch a cold.
78_Text=Your boots are soaking, dear…//Would you please wipe them off at the door?
72_Text=You’re right. There’s always <NpcName>Peanut</> and <NpcName>Butter</>. Heh heh. Ah, you made an old lady’s day, <PlayerName>$player</>.
2_Text=You’re the first visitor we’ve had in a while.//After the oil spill last year, tourists hardly come anymore.
18_Text=…Hmm… Are you all right?
21_Text=…Hmm…//You seem preoccupied, dear.
75_Text=…Oh, dear.
4_Text=Ruff ruff...ruff...ruff!
6_Text=Woof woof woof!
8_Text=Woof woof!
106_Text=*Snapping her fingers slightly off-beat*
2_Text=<NPCName>Walter</> and I own the vineyard, you see. Our clients are mostly abroad.//<portrait=normal>Shall I send over a bottle?
14_Text=<NpcName>Dinda</>’s a dear friend of mine. She’s always so sweet.
43_Text=<NpcName>Luke</> handles all the vineyard business except for the farming side of it.
96_Text=<NpcName>Luke</> used to run around the vineyard when he was little, and he’d eat grapes until his stomach hurt. Ah, ha ha.
31_Text=<NpcName>Taco</>’s a very independent pup. He likes to explore.//Sometimes I worry about him getting lost.
36_Text=<NpcName>Taco</>’s very happy. We’re so glad he came to live with us.
47_Text=<NpcName>Walter</> can be stubborn sometimes, especially when it comes to big decisions.
114_Text=<NpcName>Walter</>’ll go wild if I come home with pink hair or something.
71_Text=Actually, it was more like he grew it out really tall…//<portrait=normal>I wish he’d kept that style. He looked very nice that way.
85_Text=Ah, dear! I’ll have to ask <NpcName>Luke</> to shovel the snow tomorrow…
110_Text=Ah, fresh flowers sound good, don’t they, <PlayerName>$player</>? They really cheer the place up.
103_Text=And gossip a little about the townies, right, <NpcName>Dinda</>? Ha ha…
89_Text=Are you looking for <NpcName>Taco</>?//He should be here somewhere.
126_Text=Aren’t they great? Maybe I’ll get one for the house myself.
136_Text=At home, of course.
15_Text=Breakfast is very important, <PlayerName>$player</>. Don’t skip it!
32_Text=But he always comes home.
48_Text=But he isn’t half as pushy as some people. You know?
56_Text=But it’s nice to know that we have an extra supply.
19_Text=But please let’s keep it between us. We wouldn’t want anybody to get jealous.
7_Text=By the way, <NpcName>Ben</> sells seeds, too.//If <NpcName>Sam</> is ever closed, give <NpcName>Ben</> a try…
22_Text=Doing dishes is a chore, and it takes forever… To be perfectly honest, I’d rather cook all day.
28_Text=Doing dishes is a chore, and it takes forever…//<portrait=normal>To be perfectly honest, I’d rather cook all day.
68_Text=Farming is easier if you have automatic sprinklers…//But not everybody needs them.
88_Text=Have you eaten, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Would you like some tea? Or coffee?
38_Text=Have you settled in yet? Take your time, dear. I didn’t feel like this was home for years…//I felt comfortable right away, sure. But home? That’s always been hard for me.
44_Text=He even does his own quality control to keep our standards high…//<portrait=normal>I’m very proud of him. He’ll do very well when he takes over.
37_Text=He has so many friends around town, you know.//I think his best friend is our neighbor <NpcName>Archie</>.
6_Text=How much longer are we going to let this pile up?
26_Text=I always look forward to the town’s charming little holidays, too.
99_Text=I always loved gardening… But who’d have thought I’d actually enjoy making a living out of it?
114_Text=I better hurry.
62_Text=I brought some bok choy, and nobody touched it. What is it with vegetables, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Is it just because they’re green?
120_Text=I can’t comment on our caterer for the New Year's Eve event. It's going to be a surprise!
113_Text=I guess I know where <NpcName>Luke</> gets his indecisiveness.
83_Text=I have to be somewhere… Please excuse me.
118_Text=I have to handwrite and mail out each and every one of them by Saturday!
117_Text=I have to take care of the seating and the secret friend list really soon.
57_Text=I heard about Pufferfish moving in. I’d rather not discuss it right now.
59_Text=I hope you enjoyed the New Year’s gathering, <PlayerName>$player</>.
90_Text=I make my own bread when I can. <NpcName>Eva</>’s is a little too chewy. It’s not the best for soup.
42_Text=I usually don’t like getting my hands dirty, but I just feel better when I’m working with the earth…
100_Text=I was a little bored at home. There’s not much to do…
94_Text=I wasn’t expecting company.
124_Text=I wish <NpcName>Luke</> would worry less. He overthinks things sometimes.
133_Text=I wonder if <NpcName>Ben</> is around… He might have some.
109_Text=I wonder what <NpcName>Eva</> puts in this insanely delicious cake.//I’m determined to find out her secret!
53_Text=If you collect wild vegetables, have a look around, dear. We have plenty growing around here.
69_Text=If you only have a few rows of crops, you can probably do without them.
23_Text=In a way, farming is my therapy. I cultivate my plants and watch them grow.
8_Text=In fact, I buy a lot of things from him…//To help out his business a little, you see.
91_Text=In the Summer, I usually grill whatever fruit or vegetables I can find and just drizzle honey on them.
87_Text=It makes you think about all the things you haven’t done.
39_Text=It must be a shock to your system, moving here from a big city.
52_Text=It really shows that something doesn’t have to be logical to be beautiful.
40_Text=It was my idea to move here. I told <NpcName>Walter</> to stop chasing wealth and start enjoying it instead.
61_Text=It was such a blast last week at the lake. It’s a great way to keep the community close.
64_Text=It was tiring… Moonlighting at nightclubs every night to make ends meet until I got my big break…//That was the plan, anyway.
58_Text=It’s a bit upsetting, isn’t it? We came here to this beautiful island, hoping to get away from big corporations.//Then a part of the past followed us.
81_Text=It’s been raining like this all day… *sigh*
111_Text=It’s important to take care of yourself. It’s not selfish…//<portrait=happy>On the contrary, it can really improve your performance, and it’s good for your mood.
134_Text=It’s really time to get an herbal hair treatment, huh?//<portrait=annoyed>My hair feels so coarse… Blech!
122_Text=I’m going to try a new recipe today…
102_Text=I’m just bringing over some baked goods…
135_Text=I’m just getting my hair blown today, nothing fancy…//Something decent for a simple dinner tonight.
121_Text=I’m keeping it a secret so everybody’s surprised.
104_Text=Live music in the evening is always a good idea.
127_Text=Live music in the evening is always a good idea… *dances in her seat*
67_Text=Looking for tips? Oh, I’d love to give you some.//<portrait=normal>You have to ferment rice in a keg for several days to make sake.
60_Text=Met your standard, I hope?
29_Text=My Monday has been wonderful, thanks for asking. How's yours?//That’s good to hear, dear.
115_Text=My Monday has been wonderful. How's yours?
51_Text=My favorite style of painting has to be Impressionism.//<portrait=happy>The short, strong brush strokes really capture the essence of the subjects without getting bogged down in the details.
137_Text=New hairdo, <PlayerName>$player</>?
101_Text=Not everyone can do woodwork. You need certain skills, plus, it’s labor intensive…
13_Text=Now I eat homemade whenever I can.//<portrait=happy>To make up for the damage I did in my youth. Ha ha ha.
65_Text=Obviously, I never got my big break.//<portrait=normal>But that’s a story for another time.
116_Text=Of course, things are easier if you have automatic sprinklers…//But not everybody needs them.
73_Text=Oh my! I’m glad your toes are all covered up and warm.
72_Text=Oh no! It’s Winter already. I need to start getting ready for the annual feast.
82_Text=Oh no. You seem flushed, <PlayerName>$player</>. You’re coming down with a cold! Get some rest!
123_Text=Oh, dang! I ran out of basil. Let’s see if I can just cook it without it…
79_Text=Oh, it is hard to work in this weather.
75_Text=Oh, it's hard to work in this weather.
119_Text=Oh, it’s incredibly stressful!
1_Text=Oh, you’re the new farmer.//I was worried there for a bit about a potential competitor.//<portrait=happy>Nothing to worry about, it seems.
84_Text=Once, I went to this beautiful ski resort in a small town down south.//It looked exactly like this when it snowed.
129_Text=People don’t do that here. They see me as more than just <NpcName>Walter</>’s wife…//They see me as <NpcName>Bree</>.
128_Text=People used to stare at me when I was out with <NpcName>Walter</> back in the city.//This was way before we had <NpcName>Luke</>…
25_Text=Playing farmer in this little town is so much fun… A lot more fun than playing the wife in the big city.
63_Text=Sometimes I do miss modeling… The glam, the people…//But I don’t miss all of it. Some of it was rough.
112_Text=Sometimes, I just want to chop my hair off, but I probably won’t…//Ha ha ha! I don’t think it would suit me…
93_Text=Sorry about the mess! I haven’t straightened up.
97_Text=That boy has no self-control.
5_Text=The dumpster is such an eyesore. We want to recycle, but there’s no place to do it.
10_Text=The quality of the wine depends on the quality of the grapes.
11_Text=The same goes for our sake.
95_Text=The soil here is ideal for grapes…//And there’s the hills and just the right amount of sunlight.
41_Text=Then we were blessed with <NpcName>Luke</> a year later.
98_Text=There aren’t a lot of wild fruits here, for some reason.
70_Text=There was a period when <NpcName>Luke</> dyed his hair bright blue. Then, he grew it out really long…//<portrait=normal>No, no – without the blue dye.
24_Text=To me, farming just feels…ah…soothing. Is it the same for you?
132_Text=Too bad <NpcName>Sam</> doesn’t sell off-season produce… I’m craving baked sweet potatoes.
130_Text=Too bad <NpcName>Sam</> doesn’t sell off-season produce… I’m craving pumpkin soup.
3_Text=Ugh… Every time I walk past that dumpster, I get a headache.
105_Text=Umm… I felt like dancing tonight, so I just skipped cooking dinner and came here instead…
74_Text=We certainly don’t want them to freeze. Great call!
55_Text=We don’t necessarily have to grow grapes all year round.//In the Winter, we focus on other aspects of the vineyard.
12_Text=We don’t sell to individuals—only businesses with liquor permits.
92_Text=We have cold drinks in the fridge. Feel free!
35_Text=We make sure to have enough grapes to make wine year-round.
9_Text=We save our own seeds. That’s the only way to get consistent quality.
18_Text=We should meet up and talk about farming sometimes… Since we both seem to be working in the same field now.//<portrait=happy>Oh! That’s a pun!
4_Text=What are people putting in there? I thought we agreed to only put in clean, recyclable items.//<portrait=annoyed>Obviously, some people don’t know what clean means.
125_Text=What are you doing here, <PlayerName>$player</>? Picking up a new wall clock?
86_Text=Winter nights can be really lonely, don’t you think?//I think it’s the sense that the year is ending.
66_Text=You can grow grapes in the Fall… Are you planting some this year?
54_Text=You’re welcome to check often.
107_Text=Yummy… I wonder what <NpcName>Frank</> puts in this.
108_Text=…I need to pick up some flour… Hmm…

28_Text=Are you here to eat, <PlayerName>$player</>?
5_Text=Didn’t mean to freak you out! It’s calm most of the time. But when a lifeguard tells you to stay near the shore, pay attention.//<portrait=normal>We’re just looking out for you.
11_Text=Gimme some carbs, you know what I mean? Pizza, pasta, gnocchi…ramen!//<portrait=normal>I would kill for some ramen right now.
34_Text=Hot spring sounds so good right now.
14_Text=How about this weather, huh? Rainy one day, sunny the next.//I had no idea what to expect when I woke up this morning.
29_Text=I just love <NPCName>Frank</>’s pesto pasta. SO GOOD. I could eat a bucketful.
31_Text=I might take a class online, just to broaden my horizons. Not right now. I’m way too busy. But maybe this Winter, when it’s too cold for volleyball.
21_Text=I paid way too much for these shoes, but they’re really going to up my game. All the best players wear them.
6_Text=I started lifeguarding in high school and just stuck with it, I guess.//It’s not a hard job, and it helps me stay in shape.
33_Text=I still run down to the beach from my house, but the snow really slows me down! And when it’s icy, forget it. Trying to run on ice is a sure way to break a bone.
26_Text=I think it’s just some seaweed that washed up, but still. Ugh.
9_Text=It’s cool if it’s not your thing. I won’t hold it against you.//<portrait=normal>I mean, to me a life without volleyball seems like a pretty sad existence, but I guess you feel the same way about a life without…I dunno…corn?//Whatever you grow at your farm.
23_Text=It’s pretty, but I'm worried that the petals fall in the water and clog up the drain...<Italic>our</> drain.
10_Text=I’m STARVING, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m in training right now, and I can never get enough to eat!
35_Text=I’m so itchy today! I’ve got bug bites all over my legs.
8_Text=Join me sometime. We’ll get a game going. Gotta warn you though, I play to win.
15_Text=Luckily, the hot spring is right behind my house, so I can dip in there whenever I want.//<portrait=normal>When it’s hot, I go swimming at the beach, and when it’s cold, I soak in the hot spring.
3_Text=My job’s not just a day at the beach. *laughs* I have to be on the lookout all the time.//It only takes a split second for someone to get into trouble in the water.
30_Text=Oh, hi, <PlayerName>$player</>. How’s it going?//It's almost the end of year already...fast, huh?
32_Text=Oh. Winter’s almost here. It’s so hard to get a good workout in during the Winter months.
16_Text=The hot spring is really good for sore muscles. Nothing beats a hot soak after a hard workout.
22_Text=There’s this pink tree next to the hot spring.//Do you know what that is? Cherry, maybe?
27_Text=This storm is wild! The beach is going to be a mess tomorrow. All sorts of trash and debris washes up after weather like this.
7_Text=Volleyball, that’s my real passion. Do you play?
24_Text=Watch out for jellyfish on the beach, <PlayerName>$player</>. You do NOT want to be stung by one.
19_Text=Yikes, this rain! I’ve never seen anything like it!
20_Text=Yo, check out my new sneakers! They give me extra spring in my toes. Perfect for volleyball.
25_Text=Yo, the beach is GROSS today. Smells like dead fish.
2_Text=You're in my way.

41_Text=<NpcName>Scott</>’s a bit messy and leaves things all over the place…//<portrait=normal>But, other than that, he’s a decent housemate.
163_Text=<NpcName>Sunny</> always tries to talk me into fishing. Heh heh, funny guy.
44_Text=Access to health care is a basic human need.//So, I don’t think wealth should restrict whether or not someone gets it.
154_Text=Ah, who am I kidding? My hair isn’t this bright.//I’ve got gray hair, <PlayerName>$player</>! That’s why I keep revamping the color.//<portrait=concerned>Oh, jeez. Do youngsters still say “revamping”?
142_Text=Ahh… I woke up this morning to the realization that this island is full of clean air and good people.
107_Text=All this snow must be challenging for people in your trade.//Farming and the snowy season… Tough business.
128_Text=Am I out late? Um… I suppose the loneliness hits differently when you’re home alone on a snowy day.
34_Text=And, as a result, we can detect them easier and faster.//<portrait=happy>Early detection is the root of a successful health plan, you see.
89_Text=Another Winter’s almost passed.//Not many flu cases this year… I’m very grateful.
86_Text=Are you excited for the Harvest Festival, <PlayerName>$player</>? Personally, I can’t wait.
135_Text=Are you okay? You look flushed and sweaty.//<portrait=normal>I recommend a dose of medicine.
26_Text=But that’s just my opinion.
2_Text=By the way, I’m <NPCName>Char</>–//<portrait=surprised>ACHOOO!
151_Text=Come here often?
80_Text=Daisies don’t make me sneeze too much unless I get really close. So I just stay away from where they grow.
11_Text=Dehydration is a real thing. Your body’s mostly water and can’t work right without it. So remember to stay hydrated and drink plenty!
119_Text=Do I have something in my hair?
134_Text=Don’t shame a man for trying to sell his products, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>Vitamins help you and they help me at the same time. I don’t know what you’re talking about.//It doesn’t sound shady to me at all.
9_Text=Don’t you feel good after a good farming session, <PlayerName>$player</>?
47_Text=During my many years working in the clinic, I have never once turned away anyone in need.//That’s not what we’re about here.
169_Text=Err… I mean, to make sure her tasks are done on time.
14_Text=Especially not when you’re in the middle of a hot date.//Take a bite of that clam, then a rash suddenly breaks out and your lips start to swell.//<portrait=happy>NOT based on personal experience… *winks*
20_Text=Even if it’s just in the way I dress. Slacks and polos.

133_Text=Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>, need some more vitamins?
152_Text=Glad to see you here, <PlayerName>$player</>.
29_Text=Ha ha… What can I say? I really should heed my own medical advice sometimes.//<portrait=happy>Some things are just easier said than done, especially when burritos are involved!
85_Text=Have you gotten your flu shot yet?//Winter is next week, you know.
35_Text=Having a hobby can help you relax and help you work more efficiently in the long run.//So, if you don’t already have a hobby, maybe start reading or pick up a fishing rod.
17_Text=Health is wealth… Don’t forget that, kid!//Your money means nothing if you’re not healthy enough to enjoy them.
60_Text=Hey, I'm most certainly not mumbling incomprehensible gibberish!//I was trying to recall the names of the medicines that I need to restock.
66_Text=Hmm... I would apply more sunscreen in about an hour if I were you.//<portrait=normal>Better safe than sorry, I always say.
62_Text=Hold on a-//<portrait=surprised>ACHOO!//<portrait=normal>What I was saying was-//<portrait=surprised>ACHOO!//<portrait=normal>Okay, I think I'm good now. Where were we?
69_Text=I always change clothes as soon as I get home.// You don’t want to sleep with that pollen sticking to your clothes and hair and stuff. *shivers*
130_Text=I blame the cold weather.
104_Text=I blame the snow.
106_Text=I blame the snow. Well, at least the dinner party is coming up soon, eh?
74_Text=I can open my windows again now the pollen has calmed down.//Nothing beats waking up in the fresh air.
161_Text=I can’t believe how bright it is outside today…//If it weren’t for that ice-cold wind, you’d think it was summer!
146_Text=I can’t believe people want to drill oil here, of all places…//<portrait=normal>This island is beautiful!//Before the oil spill happened anyway.
4_Text=I can’t remember, for the life of me.//Tell you what, I’ll mail you if it comes back to me.
48_Text=I could go for a burrito right now.//<portrait=normal>Maybe some strawberries later.
32_Text=I don’t mean to scare you or anything. Just telling the truth!
110_Text=I don’t think I’ll go out and about today.
120_Text=I don’t think I’ll go out today.
5_Text=I don’t want to be rude, but I wonder what you put in those pockets of yours.//<portrait=happy>They always seem so full.
19_Text=I enjoy the conformity of fashion.//In a way, it gives me a sense of belonging.
97_Text=I feel like I’m in an oven! Where’s a nice cool breeze when you need one?//My hair’s gone nuts, as well. I just can’t seem to catch a break in this weather!
73_Text=I feel like myself again! No more endless sniffling!
24_Text=I feel very safe here… This is home to me.
165_Text=I found wild berries near the lighthouse the other day!
101_Text=I guess farmers like your good self must be busy this season, eh?
27_Text=I have this ritual that I’ve been doing for who knows how long.//So usually, on Saturdays, I like to make burritos and keep the leftovers for Sunday’s lunch.//Isn’t that fun?
122_Text=I have to go…
75_Text=I have to say…hot weather isn’t my thing.//It puffs up my hair like cotton candy.
129_Text=I haven’t felt this down for a while…
127_Text=I hope it stops snowing soon. It messes up my hair.
147_Text=I hope you don’t overfeed pet.//Playing with our pets when they’re bored is much better than just giving them treats.
81_Text=I just love Fall. There’s all the warming comfort food, and it’s not too hot or cold outside.//It’s perfect.
68_Text=I know what you’re gonna say. I should probably take allergy medicine, right? It makes me really drowsy…//Haven’t found the right one, probably.
71_Text=I like the weather, but Spring’s gotta be at the bottom of my list of favorite seasons.
49_Text=I make sure to match my tie to my hair. It’s hard to choose the right shade sometimes, but thank goodness, I got that sorted out.
90_Text=I open my windows first thing in the morning.//I like to let the cold air in.
58_Text=I popped into the tavern to see if anyone was there, but then just left. I wasn’t really feeling it today.
171_Text=I think I’ll head back home after this.//I feel exhausted.
112_Text=I think I’ll stop by the tavern after work to warm up.//On rainy days like this, I bet you the tavern is busier than ever.
95_Text=I think the heat is getting to me. I feel annoyed.
21_Text=I wear my crimson khakis when I’m feeling daring.//<portrait=happy>Have you seen me in them?//<portrait=normal>It’s quite the outfit, I’ve been told.
105_Text=I'm in a melancholy mood.
157_Text=If my pollen allergy weren’t so bad, I would buy some flowers.
144_Text=If you get cut or scraped, wash it right away with running water.//This will clean the wound.
116_Text=Is <NpcName>Millie</> looking this way? How do I look?
36_Text=Is my hair messy?
115_Text=Is my hair okay? I think the rain messed it up on the way here.
121_Text=It’s a good time to catch up on some paperwork.
100_Text=It’s bright yet soothing, warm yet refreshing, crisp yet soft, and – just like me – full of warmth.
143_Text=It’s gonna be a good day, I can feel it!
76_Text=It’s good that more people are out and about in Summer.//As long as we don’t forget the sunscreen, right?
50_Text=It’s hard to be seen next to <NpcName>Yuri</>, because she’s so green… Very garish, if you ask me.
30_Text=It’s important get your health checked regularly.//If something’s wrong, it can be picked up early.
13_Text=It’s important to be aware of our allergies.//You really don’t want to discover an allergy accidentally.
123_Text=It’s late.
28_Text=It’s okay to let loose on special occasions.//You just need to remember not to get carried away.
139_Text=It’s too bright here sometimes. It’s hard for me to nap.
124_Text=I’ll be out late today. I don’t want to be home all by myself…//I’m feeling quite lonely.
39_Text=I’ll need to cover my head in sunscreen when I’m bald…
7_Text=I’m all for farming. I think it’s an excellent activity for both body and mind.
84_Text=I’m better suited to colder weather, I think.//Not too many mosquitos, and I just wake up refreshed!
170_Text=I’m checking out a couple of books today to read over the next week.
67_Text=I’m closing my windows for the whole season.
43_Text=I’m glad that everyone here is given equal access to health care.
168_Text=I’m here to make sure <NpcName>Millie</> is doing well.
92_Text=I’m looking forward to the New Year’s Eve Festival. Are you? I can’t wait for the present exchange and to eat all the good food.//<NPCName>Bree</> is an amazing host!
108_Text=I’m noticing less variety in the fresh produce at Sam’s, compared to other seasons.
150_Text=I’m okay… Thanks!
70_Text=I’m so glad <NPCName>Yuri</> is here. She’s made of iron, that one.//I would’ve been miserable running the clinic alone with all this pollen flying around.
63_Text=I’m staying away from milk.//<portrait=annoyed>It doesn’t agree with my stomach.
52_Text=I’m trying to reduce my dairy intake. But some things are harder to cut out than others.
79_Text=I’ve already had to treat a few people for sunburn.//<portrait=surprised>Won’t name names, <PlayerName>$player</>, patient–doctor confidentiality and all that.
166_Text=I’ve yet to see this place packed.
140_Text=Joking. *chuckles*
160_Text=Just chatting away with <NpcName>Suki</>.//Besides, it’s too hot for me to be outside.
131_Text=Let me tell you something... the loneliness hits differently when you’re home alone on a snowy day.
132_Text=Let me tell you something... the loneliness hits differently when you’re home alone on a snowy day.//It makes you not want to be at home.
64_Text=Life must be exciting for farmers like you right now.
25_Text=Live and let live, I say.//As people, I think we should avoid harming others and afford each other the same respect and dignity that we expect ourselves.
51_Text=Milk gives me an upset stomach, so I try to avoid it. Honestly, I would rather not drink it at all.
72_Text=My allergies are like clockwork, <PlayerName>$player</>. As soon as it’s the first of Spring, that’s it for me.
156_Text=Never once in my life have I come here intending to buy anything, but somehow I always buy something I don’t need.
18_Text=New fashion trends are cool…but on other people.//I’m pretty comfortable with my style, so I’m sticking with it.
164_Text=Nice to see you here, <PlayerName>$player</>!
83_Text=Nothing like the crisp Fall air for enjoying some sweet potato chips.//<portrait=annoyed>I wish I had some now…
98_Text=Oh, finally, a cool breeze!
159_Text=Oh, what am I reading? Just some medical journals and fashion magazines.
65_Text=Oh, with the new season and all.//<portrait=happy>It’s an ideal time for farming, no?
37_Text=Oh, you said lazy. I thought you said my hair was MESSY.//<portrait=annoyed>Don’t scare me like that! No, I’m not being lazy. Just taking a break.
38_Text=One day, not long from now, my hair will be gone. So, I’m trying to hold on to each strand as long as I can.//Nothing’s wrong with going bald. I just can’t imagine how hot it would be under the sun, that’s all.
40_Text=Or I could always wear a hat.
46_Text=Our clinic only charges for emergency services…//And even with that, we’re highly subsidized by the government, so everyone pays a share of what they can afford.
78_Text=People can call me annoying all they want, but I’m going to keep reminding them about sunscreen. Especially in this blazing Summer sun.
23_Text=People here are open-minded. They’ve never held anything against me.
113_Text=People just don’t like to walk around in the rain, and I guess they’re bored sitting around at home.
111_Text=Rainy days like this provide a rare opportunity to catch up on some paperwork.
141_Text=Remember to put on your sunscreen.
12_Text=Sorry, I often sound stuffy in the morning.//But it usually clears up later.
88_Text=Take care of yourself this season, <PlayerName>$player</>. Winter weather can be harsh on our health…especially with less and less sunshine.//And I’m not just talking about the flu or the common cold. Winter blues is a real thing.
6_Text=That reminds me. I forgot to recycle yesterday.
42_Text=That said, he often walks straight into doors. Not just screen doors, regular solid ones too.//<portrait=annoyed>It’s amazing how successful he is, given his clumsiness.
10_Text=That’s what sunshine and physical activity does for you, my friend.//It gets the endorphins going – your feel-good pheromones.
82_Text=The best thing about Fall is definitely sweet potato chips.//Sure, I could get them in other seasons, but they’re just better in the Fall, you know?
93_Text=The heat is messing with my routine.
77_Text=The humidity isn’t helping my hair at all.//Yours is fine, though. How come? What shampoo do you use?
53_Text=The last time I went out dancing? Hmm… It had to have been last week.
3_Text=The recycling center been here since…umm…
96_Text=The sun is hammering down on me today… How am I supposed to work when it’s like this?
158_Text=There are plenty of wild fruits around here.
57_Text=There are so many people in the tavern. There’s no room to dance.//What’s the point of going if I’m not going to dance, right? I prefer to go there on Fridays.
155_Text=They don’t say “youngsters” anymore, do they?//<portrait=concerned>My age is showing.
94_Text=This heat is so annoying… I’m not feeling like myself.
125_Text=Time flies on snowy days.
109_Text=Time passes so quickly these days… Just like falling raindrops.//There one second, gone the next.
56_Text=Today is not a good day to go to the tavern. Trust me!//It’s so busy there on the weekend. Phew!
153_Text=Two drinks and I’m done. Anything more and it’s hangover city for me the next day.
162_Text=Ugh, I don’t think I put on enough sunscreen today. I hope they have extra!
61_Text=Uh oh…here it comes…spring allergies.
114_Text=Want to know what’s fun to do in this type of weather? Work.
126_Text=Want to know what’s fun to do in this type of weather? Work. Get your body moving and warm up.
137_Text=Watch your step! Slippery floor!
138_Text=We disinfect the clinic to international standards, especially after emergencies.//Excellent hygiene is critical in health care.
16_Text=We don’t charge an outrageous amount though.//Just enough to cover the cost.
33_Text=We need to start talking about mental health more, to erase the social stigma around it.
1_Text=Well, hello to yo–//ACHOOOOOO!//<portrait=annoyed>Ugh… Spring. Not the best time to move here.
45_Text=We’re lucky to never have to worry about health care.//<portrait=concerned>It’s a luxury in some parts of the world… Unfair, I know.
136_Text=What are you doing here, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=surprised>You okay?
102_Text=What do you mean, why? It’s fall. Some even call it the harvest season.
118_Text=What? Why are you looking at me like that?
15_Text=Work hard. But, more importantly, work smart.//Don’t overexert yourself and pass out, or you’ll be billed for a medical emergency.
99_Text=Wow, seems like my hair matches this season…
8_Text=You know what?//<portrait=normal>I hope more people will get out of their houses and do some farming… Or gardening. Get up and sweat it out!
91_Text=You need to layer up when you leave the house…especially in Winter.//Another tip: wash your hands when you get home. Some viruses thrive in dry, cold conditions.
54_Text=You seem interested in my dancing schedule. You’re not going to take me out dancing, are ya?
31_Text=Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.//If either is suffering, it can be catastrophic to you.
167_Text=You’re not looking for me, are you, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Because I’m off duty right now.
148_Text=You’re right, I don’t have any pets.//<portrait=normal>But that doesn’t mean I don’t know anything about them.
55_Text=’Cause I’m not going to say no. *chuckles*
129_Text=*hurrying somewhere*
66_Text=<NpcName>Ben</>'s usually out of town the last two weeks of Fall.//He likes to go on adventures, that one.
40_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> makes a mean pasta.//The kids love it.
156_Text=<NpcName>Luke</> helped me make the brochures.//Hmm… I can see that we could certainly use a new design.//<portrait=happy>This one is kind of outdated. Do you know anything about design, by any chance?
49_Text=<NpcName>Sam</> carries a different variety of crops every year.//I hope he brings back durian next year.
159_Text=<NpcName>Sam</> doesn’t give a discount.//<portrait=normal>I’ve known him for years and years, and I have never been given any sort of markdown.//Or even a rebate, for crying out loud.
39_Text=Ah, I see…//I’ll probably go to the tavern tonight and catch up with folks.
47_Text=Ah, darn… Socket is closed today.
62_Text=Ah, the good old days…
58_Text=And the fishing, of course.//You can catch salmon at sea all Summer long.
84_Text=Another week is right around the corner. Are you planting anything new at the farm?
135_Text=Anyway, how’s your day been?
105_Text=Are you going to plant pineapples this Summer? <NpcName>Sam</> might have seeds this year.
112_Text=Are you having a productive Summer, <PlayerName>$player</>? Because I sure am.
99_Text=Are you ready for Summer?//<portrait=happy>The beach is very vibrant this time of year!
77_Text=At a town meeting, I decided to ask if I should try running to replace her. There seemed to be support for me, so I did.
83_Text=At the moment, I don’t feel like traveling anymore. Because if it’s just me, is it even worth it?
61_Text=Back in the day, I would spend my Saturdays at the beach from sunrise to sundown.
41_Text=Birthday presents are the quickest way to make friends.
35_Text=Birthday presents are the quickest way to make friends.//<portrait=happy>I particularly like sake, but I wouldn’t turn down some pineapple upside-down cake either.
75_Text=But I’m not sure how I can get the funding for that.//It’s a bit tight with us trying to keep our festivals running every year.//The governor may not like the idea very much.
36_Text=Can you believe it’s almost the weekend already?
8_Text=Can you imagine how much trash there actually is at sea?
57_Text=Coral Island has very fertile soil.//You can grow almost anything here.
31_Text=Did you really see a mermaid?//<portrait=happy>Ah! You got me again. Nice one, <PlayerName>$player</>!
38_Text=Do you have any plans for the weekend?
157_Text=Do you know <NpcName>Joko</> and <NpcName>Dinda</> well?
136_Text=Doesn’t this town, covered in snow like this, remind you of that town from that movie?!
150_Text=Don’t let me stop you from mingling!
50_Text=Durian sure is my guilty pleasure.
154_Text=Fancy a room for a getaway weekend?
22_Text=For the community upgrade, I think it’s important to start where we’ll have the most impact.//This means building a community garden.
137_Text=Good day, <PlayerName>$player</>! I’m happy to see the locals are supporting each other.
161_Text=Got all you need?
56_Text=Happy Thursday, <PlayerName>$player</>!
95_Text=Have you planted any Spring seeds yet?//<portrait=happy>Sugarcane is my personal favorite.
63_Text=Have you tried growing grass?//You can cut it and it will automatically be deposited into your silo as animal feed.
158_Text=Have you tried their pineapple upside-down cakes?
43_Text=Have you watched the new commercial on TV yet?//From what I’ve seen, <NpcName>Luke</> has an eye for quality electronics.
151_Text=Heh heh... I’ve heard that story at least three times now, and it seems like it gets funnier and funnier each time.
144_Text=Hi there, <PlayerName>$player</>//Enjoying yourself?
67_Text=Hmm… That is true. His eyes do always look red.//He must not sleep very much.//<portrait=normal>That young man must have plenty of work to do.
128_Text=How are your plants holding up during the storm?
90_Text=How was your first week on the farm?//It’s been a while since someone stayed at that cabin.
24_Text=How was your weekend?//<portrait=happy>I’m going to start this week off with a cup of the tavern’s coffee.
120_Text=How’s the farm doing? I hope the old house is holding up okay.
139_Text=How’s the farm doing?//I hope the old house is holding up okay.
51_Text=I AM rather busy.//I have many things on the agenda this season, but I still like to take a fishing break here and there.
32_Text=I admit, shopping can get addictive.
85_Text=I always have less work on the weekend, except for when we hold festivals.
122_Text=I can’t hear you! Let’s get indoors and continue to chat.
146_Text=I don’t think so.//<portrait=normal>To make a point, I’m about to show you how much fun I’m having.//Just hang on a minute, you don’t want to miss my classic dance moves.
28_Text=I don’t think you need a fancy tool for it.//I believe that your standard scythe will do.
25_Text=I got some over the weekend and left it to chill in the fridge.//I keep the empty cups and use them as planters.
114_Text=I hate to police merchants’ booths at festivals, but there are regulations that people need to follow. We can’t just approve every design. What if it looks out of place?
121_Text=I haven’t seen rain this hard since…hmm…//<portrait=happy>Since the last time it rained, I guess.//Apologies, rainy days make my head a bit fuzzy.
9_Text=I hope we can clean up the trash on the ocean floor someday, so we can finally start our coral reef nursery.
138_Text=I just had a friendly chat next door and I thought I’d come here to check out what <NpcName>Luke</> has in stock.
68_Text=I might go and say hi to him next week…
46_Text=I need to visit Socket Electronics today and ask <NpcName>Luke</> where my new blender is.
42_Text=I particularly like sake, but I wouldn’t turn down some pineapple upside-down cake either.
86_Text=I saw this town panic about a flu outbreak some years ago. People were worried about stocking up food, which depleted our food supply very fast.
33_Text=I should probably update the bulletin board today and make sure there aren’t any outdated posts.
108_Text=I think I’m going to visit the <NpcName>Sanchezes</> tomorrow and see what they’ve been up to.
5_Text=I think the islanders here already have the right mindset to reduce, reuse, and recycle.//It’s a shame we don’t have an appropriate facility for it.
69_Text=I think the last time I went to your farm was when you first moved to the island.//<portrait=happy>Do you remember that?
147_Text=I used to be quite the fun machine back in the day.
76_Text=I used to run a general store in the downtown area, back in my youth. But then Mayor <NpcName>Leanne</> passed away.
107_Text=I usually spend my Summer weekends at Beach Shack, catching up with <NpcName>Nina</>.
115_Text=I wish, someday, someone would create a warm fizzy drink with dried pumpkin in it.
116_Text=I would call it “pumpkin extract drink.” Sounds good, doesn’t it?
34_Text=If you want to keep track of people’s birthdays, there’s a calendar near the community center.//Don’t worry, I make sure to update it every season.
29_Text=If you want to upgrade any of your tools, bring them over to the <NpcName>Sanchezes</>’ shop.//They know what they’re doing.
96_Text=It does take a while to grow, but we do grow the sweetest sugarcane around here.//<portrait=happy>I’m sure <NpcName>Sam</> would pay a lot for it.
70_Text=It feels like ages ago.//You’ve become a part of the community now.
73_Text=It isn’t in my power to change the law, but there’s nothing wrong with trying.
119_Text=It may be a good time to check out some other areas on this island. Or, perhaps, make friends.
26_Text=It must take plenty of work to get your farm ready for planting every season.
17_Text=It would be nice to have a place where the community can grow crops, bond, and share our produce.
1_Text=It’s good to see you out and about.//Have you introduced yourself to the townies?
88_Text=It’s nice to see the youth getting more and more involved in the community.
143_Text=It’s right next door.//<NpcName>Luke</> runs an electronics store there now.
149_Text=I’m debating whether I should take some cake home.//You know, for tomorrow.
106_Text=I’m glad <NpcName>Nina</> is coming to visit. I remember when she was born. The celebration was out of this world.
48_Text=I’m going to treat myself to a pineapple upside-down cake today.
27_Text=I’m no farmer, but clearing weeds is probably the first step.//Would you agree?
65_Text=I’m not exactly sure about <NpcName>Ben</>’s store hours.//<portrait=normal>I don’t go to that part of the forest very often.
91_Text=I’m not too happy about announcing Pufferfish’s arrival next week.//But the islanders need to know as soon as possible.
80_Text=I’m proud to say that we have excellent doctors living here.
81_Text=I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before Coral Island attracts more talented people, like you.
140_Text=I’ve been sporting this hairstyle since I was eighteen.//Perhaps it’s time for a change.
145_Text=I’ve heard people say you shouldn’t mix business with pleasure.//Well, I don’t know what to tell ya, but I’m here to check up on local businesses.//<portrait=happy>It doesn’t stop me from enjoying myself, does it?
82_Text=I’ve spent my life taking care of Coral Island. I never got to take <NpcName>Carol</> to see the world and now I spend sleepless nights regretting it.
72_Text=I’ve spoken to the governor about lowering our taxes here, and increasing the school budget.
155_Text=Just collecting data from <NpcName>Suki</> to monitor our tourism industry.//I’m also restocking our town’s brochures for the guests.
101_Text=Letting too many tax documents pile up can be mentally draining at times.//<portrait=normal>It’s good to get them done early.
16_Text=Looking for some work to do, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=happy>Ah, I was just thinking, wouldn’t it be nice if we could have a community garden?
141_Text=Nah! People seem to like it.//I’m keeping this style.
124_Text=No matter the season, it gets fairly cold when it rains here.
55_Text=Of course you can join.//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Leah</> usually leads the class.
126_Text=Oh, my! It’s been a while since it stormed like this!
142_Text=One of these days, I’m going to show you my old general store.
13_Text=Our goal is to build a recycling center for the locals to use.//Hopefully, we can teach our youth and they can carry the tradition forward.
71_Text=Part of my job is to check in on local businesses and make sure they’re doing okay.//I also make sure they’re on time with their taxes.
113_Text=Plenty of people want to join our Mooncake Festival. But with the limited town budget, I have to make sure that our merchants get their booths first, before adding more.
44_Text=Preparing for the new week, <PlayerName>$player</>?
94_Text=Pufferfish is building a mini golf course for the community and trying to buy us out.//<portrait=concerned>So, I think as long as we don’t sell our property, we have nothing to worry about.
93_Text=Pufferfish is looking to start drilling on our island.//The only thing that was stopping them from moving their cranes here was their lack of property.//They’re interested in buying us out, then drilling as much oil as possible to expand their business.
102_Text=Remember that we have a Cherry Blossom Potluck tomorrow. There will be so much food!//See you there!
74_Text=Should we put in another request for a community garden?//I can see it being beneficial to the islanders.
54_Text=Some of the islanders like to do group yoga at the community center every Saturday morning.
64_Text=Sometimes <NpcName>Ben</> has seeds that <NpcName>Sam</> doesn’t carry.//If you want to check it out, <NpcName>Ben</> opens late today.
97_Text=Spring is my least favorite season because, you know…taxes.
111_Text=Summer is here!
104_Text=Summer is here! Ah, I can feel the sun on my skin! Life’s good, eh?
87_Text=Thankfully, we got this contained quickly and the hysteria settled. But it was one expensive year for the town.
152_Text=The beach is stunning this time of year.
60_Text=The rat problem could have been way worse.//<portrait=annoyed>I heard from my other mayor friend that it destroyed their community center.//<portrait=normal>Thankfully, it’s all restored by now.
153_Text=The sea right here, <PlayerName>$player</>, is home to many creatures.
92_Text=The space they’ll occupy is theirs, to begin with.//<portrait=normal>The governor let me know they were planning to purchase your farm, but it seems like you beat them to it. So they moved here looking to buy another spot.
45_Text=The weather is perfect for diving.
37_Text=The week goes by really fast when you’re having fun or have a lot to do.//<portrait=happy>Yours must fly by!
19_Text=There aren’t that many items on the list for now, but I think we should add to it once we see how our island progresses.
123_Text=There is something about rainy nights. So soothing.
18_Text=There’s a list of community upgrades that we can do.//It’s in the community center.
110_Text=There’s no better time for me to tighten my hat. Now that the sun is blazing nonstop, I need this hat on me at all times.
30_Text=They live in the woodlands, just across the river from my house.
109_Text=They’re a lot of fun to chat with. That <NpcName>Pablo</> always has some stories!
134_Text=Umm… I can’t think of the name, but you know what I’m talking about.//<portrait=happy>The famous movie! With the snow and the town.
162_Text=Unbelievable view from up here.
59_Text=We are incredibly blessed here, with the weather and fertile soil, and not too many rat problems.//To give back, it’s important for us to take care of our environment.
23_Text=We should put the resources into significantly improving our island and our standard of living.
160_Text=Well, okay. <NpcName>Sam</> carries the best-quality produce, and to be fair, his price isn’t too bad.//<portrait=happy>So, you’re right. I really can’t complain, can I?
98_Text=Well, that was harsh of me.//<portrait=happy>Spring is great, actually, with all the colorful tulips growing around the island. Bamboo shoots!
4_Text=We’ve been setting aside recyclables in that lot near the park.//I’m hoping someday we can build something there.
103_Text=What is a better way to celebrate Spring, eh?
148_Text=What’s a Sunday without a little trip to the tavern, right <PlayerName>$player</>?
53_Text=Yes, he’s <NpcName>Oliver</>’s dad and is the one near the cash register.//<portrait=happy>Not the one in the kitchen.
89_Text=You are setting an excellent example for all of us, <PlayerName>$player</>. Keep up the good work!
117_Text=You guys have a pumpkin extract drink in Pokyo?! Lucky you.
118_Text=You probably can’t farm all that much in this harsh weather, eh <PlayerName>$player</>?
100_Text=You should keep some of your Spring vegetables in a chest, in case you need them for something.
52_Text=You should talk to <NpcName>Sunny</> at Beach Shack if you have any questions about fishing.

4_Text=It's nice to be outdoors, you agree?
6_Text=Oh hey! What's up?
2_Text=Sorry about all the noise and dust we're making. We can't really avoid that.

155_Text=Are you here for the yoga class too, <PlayerName>$player</>?
124_Text=Are you looking for anything in particular?
48_Text=As carpenters, <NpcName>Joko</> and I rely heavily on furniture sales.//<portrait=normal>Getting a project is a great way to make some cash because we’re paid up front, but let’s face it!//<portrait=concerned>Large projects don’t come around often.
75_Text=But when I take on some projects, I don’t usually craft. I try not to strain myself.

68_Text=Do you have any projects for me?
146_Text=Do you know that white oak is the easiest wood to bend?//My father told me that.
97_Text=Doesn’t it take a while for pumpkins to grow?//I’m afraid if you start now, you might not be able to harvest them in time.
137_Text=Don’t worry about your boots! No need to take them off.
89_Text=Exciting, isn’t it?!
30_Text=Favorite fruit? Hmm…//I have to go with melon.
5_Text=For sure! I hope you find what you’re looking for here, <PlayerName>$player</>.//We’re certainly happy to have you.
104_Text=Frostbite is a real thing, <PlayerName>$player</>. You be careful, okay?//Keep those socks on and your feet dry at all times.
139_Text=Have you had dinner? We have some leftovers, if you’d like.
26_Text=Have you watched the weather channel today?
130_Text=He told me my vaccinations were up to date, and that was it.//I don’t know how to feel about that.
165_Text=He's a very nifty florist. I came here for a bouquet.
18_Text=Herbs are easy to grow.//As long as you don’t overwater them, they basically grow themselves.
98_Text=Hmm… Maybe I am overthinking this a bit.
44_Text=Hot Summer days are best spent eating freshly harvested melons.//<portrait=happy>My nephew <NpcName>Surya</> and <NpcName>Millie</> both love them too.
116_Text=Hot milk sounds good right now. It’s too bad we ran out.//<portrait=concerned>Time for groceries, I suppose.
36_Text=How are you today, <PlayerName>$player</>?
129_Text=I almost cut my finger off chopping wood one time, and all <NpcName>Charles</> did was bandage it up.//<portrait=concerned>He didn’t even give me a tetanus shot.
121_Text=I can take your order in the shed in a minute.//Do you need anything urgent?
73_Text=I can teach you how to make some of them, but it would be safer to buy the plans.
112_Text=I can’t wait for Spring.//There aren’t many options for fresh flowers this time of year.
169_Text=I don't know what type of fish are in this lake, <NpcName>Archie</>.//Your uncle might be able to help with that.
12_Text=I don’t have enough land to plant large vegetables, like pumpkins.
135_Text=I don’t think <NpcName>Taco</> likes our house very much. Every time he comes in, he goes right back out.//I think it might be too noisy for him.
127_Text=I don’t think I could live at the beach, like <NpcName>Sunny</> does.//<portrait=normal>The sun is always so intense over there.
161_Text=I enjoy gathering wild vegetables.//It’s always exciting to see what nature has to offer.
145_Text=I found some wasabi earlier. Is it even in season?
82_Text=I gathered a lot of bamboo shoots over the weekend.//Have you found any yet?
96_Text=I get a bit worried when <NpcName>Archie</> gets picky about his food.
151_Text=I got a bit of a warm-up before my yoga session. I feel very awake now.
76_Text=I guarantee I’ll sleep great tonight after all the stretching.
90_Text=I guess you can call it a hobby.//I use the leftover logs to make wall clocks in my spare time.
88_Text=I hardly noticed that it’s Fall already, what with all the work to prepare for the Harvest Festival.
81_Text=I have to check out the lake this weekend and gather some Spring vegetables.
84_Text=I have to check out the lake this weekend and gather some shallots.
61_Text=I hope you’re doing well today, <PlayerName>$player</>.
77_Text=I post help requests on the bulletin board several times a year and the people here seem to want to help.
66_Text=I pulled a muscle on Saturday, trying to stretch.
4_Text=I see. Don’t get discouraged! I hope you find what you’re looking for here.
141_Text=I should just read my book.
8_Text=I taught <NpcName>Archie</> to bring back things that don’t look like they belong when he plays in the forest.
65_Text=I think I’m going to make some pies for dinner tonight.
166_Text=I think it’s admirable that <NpcName>Ben</> tries not to consume animal products.//So, keep that in mind when you’re choosing gifts for him.
9_Text=I was hoping he’d bring back trash and empty bottles.//<portrait=annoyed>But instead he brought home a lot of “shiny rocks” because they “didn’t look like they belong.”
14_Text=I was just chatting with <NpcName>Jack</> about starting a small vegetable garden.
42_Text=I wish <NpcName>Archie</> would bring in less dirt from the forest.//<portrait=normal>He sees things on the ground and they’re suddenly “treasures.”
120_Text=I wonder why my celery keeps wilting.
152_Text=I would like to see more classes held. It’s a beautiful way to bond with the community.
143_Text=If you want to look at our furniture collection, please come back tomorrow.//I should be in the shed, and I can show it to you.
6_Text=If you’re on the way to the dumpster, will you take some of my recycling and drop it off, please?
149_Text=Imagine what we could achieve if most people did that.
108_Text=Is everything okay? No leaks, I hope?
147_Text=It allows me to make some oddly designed furniture.
55_Text=It’s Friday again.//We have yoga in front of the community center tomorrow...if it isn't raining, that is.
34_Text=It’s a great way to socialize.
162_Text=It’s a nice break to come here after work once in a while.
80_Text=It’s bamboo shoot season!
128_Text=It’s great to be in the sun every once in a while, but all the time? I don’t think so//I need my cool breeze.
154_Text=It’s great to see you out and about!
142_Text=It’s nice of you to visit, <PlayerName>$player</>!
39_Text=It’s not urgent, is it?
93_Text=It’s probably not a good time to start planting pumpkins, huh?
110_Text=I’m a bit busy. Please feel free to hang around, though.
59_Text=I’m going to relax and work on my flexibility.
158_Text=I’m not here to see the mayor.//<portrait=happy>There are plenty of wild vegetables around here. Foraging them is my favorite activity.
157_Text=I’m not positive, though. I was a bit preoccupied.
125_Text=I’m so glad <NpcName>Sam</> doesn’t give out plastic bags.//There is no reason we can’t just shove fruit and veggies into our own bags.
40_Text=Jam makes a great gift.//I make sure to pack some jars for <NpcName>Joko</>’s family every time he goes to visit them.
123_Text=Just write your request in the register, and <NPCName>Joko</> and I will be on our way.
119_Text=Keeping these herbs healthy is not as easy as it looks.//It took me a couple of months to learn the secret!
22_Text=Making a cabinet is easier than you think. It just takes a lot of time.
35_Text=Making a cabinet is easier than you think.//It just takes a lot of time.
13_Text=Maybe, when I have a chance, I’ll think about expanding my garden a little bit.//<portrait=concerned>But right now, it’s just not a good time.
64_Text=Mine has been good. Thank you for asking.
148_Text=More people should make a habit of picking up trash and throwing it away.//Even if it’s not their trash to begin with.
111_Text=My hometown doesn’t get snow. So this is all new to me.//Even though I’ve lived here almost my whole life, I’m still not used to it yet.
67_Text=My leg still feels a bit funny now…//But hopefully it will go away soon.
7_Text=No worries, if you can’t.//<portrait=concerned>I’m just so swamped today.
72_Text=Not all woodwork is complicated.//There are some simple things that you can make yourself.
168_Text=Oh, he called you that too! What a fun coincidence.
99_Text=Oh, you poor thing. It must be so cold outside!
74_Text=On a slow day like this, I can make two or three shipping crates.
54_Text=On top of that, you also need to provide the building materials.
144_Text=Please, help yourself!
163_Text=Plenty of wild vegetables today!
70_Text=Some smaller items, like a doghouse or a shipping crate, can be finished on the same day.
86_Text=Sometimes he only wants to eat one or two kinds of food for weeks.//<portrait=happy>Good thing he has a healthy appetite for outdoor activity, though.
102_Text=Take a seat and warm up.
3_Text=That’s great to hear! I hope you find what you’re looking for here.
131_Text=The bad thing about the shed being connected to the house is the excessive noise.
118_Text=The best part of the day is the morning mist, don’t you think?
25_Text=The hardest thing to craft, for me, would probably be a nice wall clock.
156_Text=The mayor? I saw him going toward town earlier.
58_Text=The shop is going to be closed tomorrow.//We're heading down to the community center in the morning.
140_Text=There are so many channels. Two would be just fine.//This many feels very overwhelming.
126_Text=There’s already too much plastic in the world.//<portrait=normal>The least we can do is to use as little as possible. Reuse the containers, <PlayerName>$player</>!
164_Text=These can last us the whole week.
28_Text=Too bad you can’t plant them year-round, though.
83_Text=Try checking near <NpcName>Dippa</>’s house. There may be some over there.
109_Text=Try not to stand in the rain too long, <PlayerName>$player</>.//I can’t imagine that’s good for your health.
24_Text=Tuesday is a workday for us. Judging from your boots, that seems to be the case for you too!
32_Text=Typically, it takes me two to three days to complete a project.//<portrait=happy>So it would be wise for you to plan ahead before committing to one.
15_Text=We all can chip in our time and energy, and we can take what we need from the garden.//<portrait=happy>Sort of like a community garden, yes.
71_Text=We always have those in stock because of how popular they are.//So, all I need to do is put it together.
132_Text=We do most of our woodworking outdoors, but we still do some of it inside, you know.//So you can imagine how that can be distracting for the family.
56_Text=We live next to a forest, and steps away from the beach.//<portrait=happy>I assure you, <PlayerName>$player</>. For me, life can’t get any better than this.
153_Text=We never miss a class. You can most likely find us here on Saturdays.
133_Text=We use dovetail joints on all our furniture.//It’s the strongest joint, and the design is aesthetically pleasing.
122_Text=Welcome! I have no projects right now, so if you have any building upgrades to work on, we can start first thing tomorrow morning.
69_Text=Well, if you ever need a barn or even a pet house, you know where to find me.
38_Text=We’re closed today…
138_Text=What brought you here so late, <PlayerName>$player</>?
150_Text=What time is the yoga going to start today?
114_Text=What’s Winter without little snow, right?
47_Text=With all that land you have, farming can be a good way to make some fast money.
2_Text=Wow! That’s great to hear.
41_Text=You can make any fruit into jam, as long as you have some of those preserves jars on your farm.
134_Text=You can still stay inside your cabin tonight, even if you choose to upgrade it.//We don’t usually start working until morning.
31_Text=You can tell how sweet a melon is by pushing your finger on the round spot where the vine was attached.//It should release a sweet scent.
53_Text=You need to have enough money before we can start a project.
62_Text=You need to have enough money before we can start a project.//We require payment up front.
19_Text=You probably have more gardening tips than I do.
159_Text=You should check the lake for mushrooms!//There were plenty over there the other week.
65_Text=<NPCName>Ben</> supplies me with out-of-season items sometimes. He’s strangely very resourceful.
75_Text=A good bout of emotion can be addictive. It’s my sole source of inspiration.//Without it, life is boring, and boring is not a way to live.
64_Text=A little sip into an oasis of inspiration, I call it. Ha ha.
122_Text=Ah, those pictures are from my performing days. They’re covered with dust now.
91_Text=All of our crops died. It's too cold, I think.
72_Text=An artist should never be afraid to show emotion.//I try very hard to engage with my feelings before creating art.
43_Text=Anyone who goes through a life-changing incident knows that. Life goes on.//There are other things in life, believe it or not… There are always other things in life.
108_Text=Anything can be an inspiration. Flowers, animals… Life events.
94_Text=Are you looking for anything?
135_Text=As a kid, I loved to paint. It fell by the wayside when I…went down another career path.
37_Text=Back in the day, my hair color needed to be natural. You know, a work requirement.//They didn’t let us have a vibrant color. Didn’t want to attract attention, they said.
20_Text=Besides painting on canvas, I collect rocks and use them as a painting surface.//<portrait=happy>They’re very economical.
27_Text=Besides painting on canvas, I collect rocks and use them as a painting surface.//They’re very economical.
136_Text=But I’m back at it. Didn’t have much of a choice.
151_Text=But the rain actually washed away parts of it I hated.//The rest I could fix easily.//<portrait=happy>Happy accident. My favorite artist taught me that.
129_Text=By the way, <NPCName>Sam</> was <NPCName>Emma</>’s old boss. He was the one who supported her taco truck in the beginning.//<portrait=happy>He gave her free groceries until she could support herself with the business.
161_Text=Can you move a little? You’re in the way.
35_Text=Do you ever kind of feel like you’re missing your old self sometimes?
107_Text=Do you have one of those heaters we can borrow?
134_Text=Don’t. Dwelling on that stuff will kill your spirit.
57_Text=Farming isn’t something I can physically do, unfortunately. No more physical work for me.//I did enough in my youth to last the rest of my life. Now I paint, for crying out loud.
17_Text=Fruits and wildlife are inspirations for me. They’re so pure and free.
97_Text=Gah, so gloomy. It’s so depressing.
81_Text=Gah… Another festival is coming up. It’s so exhausting to have to go to so many community activities.//I’d rather stay at home, but I know <NPCName>Emma</> would like to go.
78_Text=Gah… Sunshine.//<portrait=annoyed>I hate it.
105_Text=Go home, <PlayerName>$player</>. It isn’t safe wandering around in the dark during a storm like this.
147_Text=Good. It’s good for you. Self-expression and stuff.
68_Text=Hate self-doubt. It kills the fun.
140_Text=Have you ever had <NPCName>Emma</>’s tacos?//They’re killer.
9_Text=Hey, thanks for clearing up debris on that lot. A couple of times on my way to paint, I saw you’d done it.//I chill there sometimes, but I don’t have farming tools, so I appreciate your doing that.
115_Text=Hmm… How do you know when a painting is finished?//<portrait=happy>You don’t. You let your creativity dictate.//<portrait=normal>If it’s finished, then it will feel finished. Until then, keep painting.
132_Text=Hobbies? Uh… I like to paint.//That’s about it.
12_Text=How do you avoid getting bit by bugs while clearing up empty lots?
1_Text=Huh? <PlayerName>$player</>?//I’m <NPCName>Dippa</>.
156_Text=I actually don’t care if what I paint here sells or not. It makes me happy.
38_Text=I can do whatever I want to my hair now, and nobody cares.//I could dye it purple tomorrow, and it wouldn’t matter. It doesn’t make any difference, because I don’t perform anymore.
70_Text=I could use a nice big jar of fresh jam right now.//Strawberry jam. I should harvest some from my garden. They're in season.
93_Text=I could use a nice long walk right now.//I want to admire the town being covered with snow before it all melts.
66_Text=I do wonder from time to time where he gets his stuff.
125_Text=I don’t give pointers. You should paint you.//Get drenched in emotion; be honest with yourself.
124_Text=I feel full of creativity and inspiration.//<portrait=happy>Nature spoke to me today.
6_Text=I guess people are going to complain no matter what. The dumpster is just there so we can store our recyclables.//It’s not like anyone breaks their back falling in there or anything.
48_Text=I hate drinking. The alcohol smell is the worst.
90_Text=I hope you have a fireplace in your cabin with this type of weather.
110_Text=I like painting inanimate objects.//The challenge of bringing them to life grounds me.
158_Text=I like this spot. Got a nice view.
73_Text=I like to magnify my feelings and emotions, then I get to work and pour them into the canvas.
60_Text=I miss performing.
118_Text=I need to paint them. Nature chose birds’ nests as my next subject.
85_Text=I painted falling leaves the other day. It turned out okay, but I’m not satisfied with it.
89_Text=I really don’t want to walk in the snow.//My boots get all cold and soggy...gah!
99_Text=I really have to go.
45_Text=I said it’s a total time saver… Humph.
59_Text=I see these kids at school, and I see hope.//I don’t know what I’m hoping exactly, but it makes it seem like the world isn’t as dark as it feels, you know?
102_Text=I see these kids at school, and I see hope.//I don’t know what I’m hoping exactly, but it makes it seems like the world isn’t as dark as it feels, you know.
128_Text=I suppose one of us should be, huh?
77_Text=I took some sand from the beach the other day and used it in my latest painting.//It seems fitting, you know. It <Italic>is</> Summer.
138_Text=I tried meditating, but it didn’t go well. Mindfulness doesn’t stop the back pain.
159_Text=I try to look closely when I paint here. The closer I look, the more unusual my paintings get.
137_Text=I wish I could say other people’s opinions don’t bother me. But everyone needs validation.
121_Text=If I only had my old job back, I’d be able to afford more than this.
116_Text=If you’re looking for <NPCName>Emma</>, she should be by the school somewhere.
119_Text=If you’re looking for <NPCName>Emma</>, she should be in the woodland somewhere.
113_Text=It makes me happy.//<portrait=happy>Can’t you tell?
152_Text=It sure is snowing. Glad you don’t have to farm in this weather.//But then, what ARE you gonna do?
86_Text=It’s generic and bland. It’s missing something, that’s for sure.
127_Text=It’s nice to see you in such good spirits, <PlayerName>$player</>.
36_Text=It’s okay to feel that way, I think.//I miss my performing days all the time.
153_Text=It’s wild to me that this island gets snow when the Summers get so dang hot.
98_Text=I’d rather be inside.//I don’t wanna get muddy.
16_Text=I’m not a fan of the night skies. The darkness and silence only make me feel sadness and sorrow.
123_Text=I’m on a roll right now.
34_Text=I’m plenty expressive. I’m smiling right now.//Can’t you see my excitement?
112_Text=I’m using my favorite brush to paint today.
58_Text=Me! I used to do gymnastics five days a week. Now I walk to exercise.//Life is funny like that.
33_Text=Me? Expressionless?//Nonsense.
21_Text=Meditating first thing in the morning helps me map out my day.//You gotta know what you want in a day in order to get it done, <PlayerName>$player</>.
146_Text=Meh. It’s a skill. Anyone can learn how, if they’re stubborn enough.
25_Text=My brain is clogged. I could really use some inspiration right now… Or a nice long walk.
106_Text=My brain is clogged. I could really use some inspiration right now…//<portrait=concerned>Or a nice long walk.
109_Text=My fear is someday I might run out of inspiration. Then what would I make of myself…
62_Text=My week has been good. What’s up, <PlayerName>$player</>?
154_Text=Nature sells. But it’s also comforting, in a way.
42_Text=Not everyone can follow their passion. And you know what? That’s okay.
61_Text=Now I can’t even take <NPCName>Emma</> to watch them without being such a bummer about it.
79_Text=Oh my!//If somebody tells me to have a great day one more time…
2_Text=Oh, a corporate employee?//And now you’re a farmer – what a twist, huh?
5_Text=Oh, good gosh!//Are people really complaining about the dumpster near the community center?
8_Text=Oh, right, right! I meant the lot near <NPCName>Frank</>’s house.
150_Text=One time, I was doing this huge outdoor painting project, and it started pouring.//I nearly had a panic attack.
126_Text=Only then can you let yourself go on the canvas.//Until then, I’m afraid your paintings will be empty.
80_Text=Oops, sorry. I think I'm having a bad day...if you'll excuse me.
120_Text=Our cottage is pretty small, huh?//I don’t know what we’d do if we decided to get a pet.
76_Text=Our garden is lush this Summer. It feels good to eat our own harvest.
69_Text=Pufferfish? Oh, I don’t care about things like that.//They own the place, so they’re free to use it however they like.
149_Text=Rain is good for your crops, right?//Neat.
148_Text=Really? You’ll have to show me your work sometime.
44_Text=Reruns are the best. You know precisely what you’re going to get, and you already know whether or not it’s good! A total time saver.
15_Text=Sadly, many painters only get appreciation after their tragic death.//<portrait=concerned>Things like that make you think, don’t they?
130_Text=She’s very grateful for them… Oh, <NPCName>Sam</> and <NPCName>Emily</>, I mean.
145_Text=So, uh… You ever do art, <PlayerName>$player</>?
111_Text=Some days I get too deep in thought, and all of a sudden, it’s nighttime.
22_Text=Some days, small things seem like such a chore, though.
74_Text=Some of my best work is from my dark days.//It just seems easier to create when I’m in the depths.//It's hard to do in Summer.
71_Text=Some of my paintings were painted in tears, so I hope people who look at them get the same morose feeling.//It doesn't need to be sad tears...it can also be happy ones like the sense of beginning in Spring after a long Winter.
114_Text=Sometimes, I use wool or fresh flowers to paint. It's fun to change things up.
63_Text=Started my day off with some hash browns and hot coffee.
14_Text=That’s the beauty of art, isn’t it? So unpredictable.
155_Text=The lake has seen better days…but the ocean is even worse.
144_Text=The what?? Ah! Interesting. I’ve been a few times.//<portrait=happy>It’s…a bit much for me, at my age.
117_Text=There are birds’ nests everywhere. I think it’s a sign for me.
96_Text=There isn’t much for me to do when it rains, so I figured I’d help <NPCName>Luke</> out with his display.
95_Text=There isn’t much for me to do when it rains, so I usually catch up on my reading here.
101_Text=There isn’t much for me to do when it storms, so I figured I’d help <NPCName>Luke</> out with his display.
100_Text=There isn’t much for me to do when it storms, so I usually catch up on my reading here.
160_Text=This is a nice spot for painting people.
28_Text=Town life isn’t for me. Socializing is too exhausting.
131_Text=Ugh… My back is killing me.
157_Text=Want to watch TV with me? I love this show.
82_Text=Well, at least there’ll be free mooncakes.
19_Text=We’re not all-knowing beings.//Don’t forget that.
143_Text=Where are you from, anyway? Never asked.//I mean where in Pokyo City did you live?
18_Text=Who’s to say mangoes and jackfruits aren’t sentient?//We tend to claim too much, while in reality, we know so little.
67_Text=Why do I feel like my creativity just isn’t flowing if I’m not in some sort of… Never mind.
41_Text=You can get some of my paintings from Socket Electronics.//<NPCName>Luke</> carries some in his store.
142_Text=You doing okay? Good.
40_Text=You don’t look very clean.//<portrait=happy>No offense.
141_Text=You ever listen to The Luwaks? Punk band.//Love ’em. Give their latest album a listen if you get time.
133_Text=You ever think about how your life could have gone if you hadn’t made some little mistake?
13_Text=You never know when inspiration might come. It can be now…//Or an hour from now, or even tonight, when I’m about to fall asleep.
139_Text=You're right. I guess it works for some people. Not me, though.
7_Text=<NpcName>Suki</> has great bug repellent solutions. I believe she made them herself.//It comes in handy in Summer.
16_Text=Catch any good bugs lately? Bring them to the museum if you want to contribute to our insect exhibit.
14_Text=Green tea has a lot of health benefits. It may even protect the brain from aging! But, mainly, I like the taste.
3_Text=I like to spend my Spring mornings in Garden Lane.//<portrait=happy>It's close by and have you seen the area? Incredibly gorgeous.
1_Text=I was telling the mayor that I didn't think anyone would want to visit the island until we get rid of those tar at the beach, but you proved me wrong.//Welcome to the community!
13_Text=I’m glad we have a good coffee bar here in Starlet Town, but to tell you the truth I’d much rather have a cup of green tea than a cup of coffee.
6_Text=Living at the beach can get intense during this time of year.//<portrait=concerned>Even with our windows opens, sometimes we still can't beat the heat at night.
5_Text=My brooch? Err...//<portrait=normal>They're special to me. Not expensive...nothing like that.//More like, <NpcName>Sunny</> gifted them to me on the day we brought <NpcName>Oliver</> home from Pokyo.
18_Text=Oh gosh...it's storming alright.
9_Text=Oof! No more humidity. I have to manually curl my hair now.//<portrait=normal>Good thing I have a short hair.
24_Text=Sometimes at night, I take <NpcName>Oliver</> to the second floor porch and we would spend the night watching the snow falling to water.
10_Text=The Beach Shack has been smoking a lot of salmon lately.//<portrait=annoyed>The smoke are often trapped in the second floor for the whole day...no matter how many times we change our clothes, we end up smelling like smoked salmon.
23_Text=The Museum is cold in Winter.//I guess the tall ceiling doesn't help. It gets REALLY cold at times.
4_Text=The Museum is nice and warm now.//Not too hot...not too cold. It's comfortable to work in Spring.
21_Text=The rain is pretty hard at night. I should be going home.
22_Text=This rain isn’t good for our caterpillars! I covered the terrarium with a plastic bin. We don’t want those little guys to drown!//I'm going to go and do more of that.
17_Text=This rain isn’t good for our caterpillars! I covered the terrarium with a plastic bin.//We don’t want those little guys to drown!
12_Text=Well… I don’t know if that’s a very good metaphor, to be honest.//I just know I love those little fruits!
15_Text=We’re always looking for donations at the museum. Please stop by if you have any interesting bugs you’d like to share!
11_Text=When a caterpillar spins its chrysalis, it’s an ugly little thing! But then a beautiful butterfly emerges.//And lychees are the same… Ugly on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside.
2_Text=Yeah, you're right. The island isn't like what it used to be.//It is what it is.
133_Text=*busily arranging shelves*
75_Text=<NPCName>Ben</> has a stunning collection. Though you’ll never know when he has something new. Hmm…
109_Text=<NPCName>Erika</> and I don’t have set customers, per se.//But customers usually have a preference for who they want to work on their hair.
9_Text=<NPCName>Eva</> is a talented baker. She reminds me a lot of <NPCName>Betty</>.
70_Text=<NPCName>Sam</> and I are going out dancing at the Tavern tomorrow night. You should join us!
81_Text=<NPCName>Sam</>’s in the mood for fried rice, and it isn’t the same without fresh shallots.//<portrait=concerned>If you ever make it yourself, you’ll agree with me.
47_Text=Acceptance… That one is hard to take in.
85_Text=Ah, I’m being dramatic again. I think I’ll cool off and have some ice cream or something.//<portrait=annoyed>The heat is making me fuzzy.
97_Text=Ah, I’m being dramatic.
82_Text=Ah, you’d think it would be easier for us to get the groceries we need, what with owning a general store and all.
126_Text=And look how pretty it is now. Islanders can come here and have a picnic.
88_Text=Are you ready for snow season? The kids are going to love it. //<portrait=happy>They usually gather in that park over there, building snowmen. Ah!
52_Text=As the saying goes, “Sunday clears away the rust of the week.”//<portrait=normal>Oh! What a fun thing to say!
73_Text=Both good things and bad things, we learn from.
110_Text=Business is going okay at the farm, <PlayerName>$player</>?
132_Text=Can I get you anything?
139_Text=Do I talk to <NPCName>Noah</> or <NPCName>Frank</> about this? Who’s in charge in here tonight?
41_Text=Do you know who <NPCName>Lily</> reminds me of? Take a guess!//<portrait=happy>Oh my… This is fun.
118_Text=Don’t you think a boutique hotel type thing would do splendidly here?
62_Text=Goodness knows, it was a long time ago. I tried growing it out a bit one time, but it’s just not me.
108_Text=Gosh, I sound like a salesperson. Ha ha!
128_Text=Have you found any flowers? Oh dear… I sure hope I didn’t pick all of the flowers. There were plenty of them left, earlier.
45_Text=Have you tried your luck in the kitchen?
96_Text=How about the rain, huh? How are we supposed to go on like this?
103_Text=How’s your Winter so far? I hope the cold and the mountain of snow doesn’t put you off.
72_Text=I believe that everything happens for a reason, be it good or bad.
74_Text=I collect many things… Antique furniture, for example. I’m always in the market for that.
2_Text=I don’t often go to the part of the island where your farm is.//<portrait=annoyed>It was overgrown the last time I visited. What a disaster.//How is it so far?
69_Text=I don’t shop much at Socket. It’s not my taste.
31_Text=I feel like scavenging tomorrow.
50_Text=I feel like scavenging tomorrow. Maybe I’ll visit your farm on the way.
127_Text=I filled a basket full of wild fruit and flowers… There were plenty near the shrine, over there.
112_Text=I have a bit of free time this morning, before errands.
123_Text=I have mixed feelings about putting a TV in our bedroom.//I feel like it might be too much of a distraction.
134_Text=I have to go to work soon. Let me just finish up with this shelf.
111_Text=I have to mention this before I forget.//<portrait=normal>I felt that you would visit today, for some odd reason… I’m glad you did. My instinct never fails me.
122_Text=I have to read for half an hour or so before going to bed. It’s become a habit, I think…//I can’t just close my eyes and fall asleep.
89_Text=I hope Winter isn’t as cold this year.//<portrait=normal>I can’t seem to find my wool gloves anywhere.
99_Text=I just wish there was something we could do to help.
35_Text=I know this may sound random, but I just want to say that sometimes things don’t make sense, and that’s okay…//Oh, you’re so young and have so much life ahead of you.
16_Text=I may talk to him about it, but I don’t know if that would be the right call…//<portrait=concerned>Probably not.
92_Text=I might go to the lake later. Rainy days are perfect for berry hunting.//Can you guess why?
39_Text=I prefer decor that has a meaningful story over something that’s brand new and clean looking.
95_Text=I really should rest… I’m starting to feel sleepy.
22_Text=I sound more and more nosy. I hope you don’t think I’m trying to police folks.
68_Text=I suppose if you miss an episode, it’s good that they rerun it.
80_Text=I went to check for some shallots out back near the lake yesterday. But nothing. Maybe I should check again today and see if they’ve sprouted.
15_Text=If <NPCName>Sam</> stops bringing in supplies from the mainland, maybe more people will start farming again.
51_Text=If that’s all right by you?//<portrait=normal>I don’t want to cross any boundaries or anything.
18_Text=Inhale…exhale… I’m trying to relax a little.
113_Text=It’s become a habit of mine to wind down with a cup of green tea after a long day of work.
7_Text=It’s crunchy and sweet.//<portrait=normal>Easy to toss after a long day of work.
83_Text=It’s easier for us than the general public, true…//But still, we rely a lot on local gardeners like you, <PlayerName>$player</>.
129_Text=It’s too nice of a day to stay inside, isn’t it?
49_Text=It’s your voice that matters first, my dear. Then consider others.//Try not to get it confused. I know, I sometimes do.
131_Text=I’m glad you did, by the way. Now someone will take care of the land.
117_Text=I’m going to take it easy and eat only raw food today.
93_Text=Less competition, correct! Great minds think alike, they say.
116_Text=Maybe it’s the greenery that my eyes are longing for, lately.//<portrait=normal>My body is craving some nature.
114_Text=My gut tells me that today is going to be a relaxing day.
61_Text=My hair is my signature, you know. I have been wearing it like this since I was a bachelorette.
77_Text=My hairspray doesn’t hold all day… I should write the company and let them know. What a disaster!
120_Text=No, I’m not a diver… But you go ahead! I'm a Sagittarius, you know... Fire and water don't mix.
84_Text=Oh my! I can do with a little rain right now.//The heat is destroying my hair!
76_Text=Oh my, I need to get my hair done. I can’t possibly go out like this!
32_Text=Oh no! I have work tomorrow.//<portrait=concerned>Perhaps over the weekend. It’s better for running around the island.
71_Text=Oh, I hope <NPCName>Theo</> is there! He has such a fabulous voice!
1_Text=Oh, the new neighbor.//<portrait=happy>So, someone really <Italic>was</> moving into town, huh?//<portrait=normal>I couldn’t believe it until I saw you myself.
125_Text=Oh, you should have seen this place! This was overgrown before Mayor <NPCName>Connor</> decided to bring everybody together to clean it up a bit.
21_Text=Remember to eat your greens, <PlayerName>$player</>.//The more color on your plate, the better.
104_Text=Snowing again? Seriously, how are we going to survive this Winter if the sun keeps hiding like this?
115_Text=Something told me to come here.
25_Text=Sometimes we forget to consider the most important opinion when we make big decisions – our own.
48_Text=Sometimes we forget to consider the most important opinion when we make crucial decisions – our own.
44_Text=Stew is easy to make. It’s also impossible to mess up.//It was one of the first meals I learned to cook.
98_Text=Storming again? Seriously, how are we going to survive this Winter if the sun keeps hiding like this?
40_Text=That feels empty to me.//<portrait=happy>But of course, sometimes there are exceptions…
124_Text=That’s a very good point. It is convenient.
6_Text=The assorted grilled platter is my all-time favorite.
136_Text=The cups could use a little chilling before serving. Then it would be just right.
91_Text=The key is to find more activities to keep myself busy.//<portrait=normal>The less free time I have, the less I’ll have to complain about. You should try that.
3_Text=The salon is closed today, my dear. <NPCName>Erika</> is busy volunteering at the school.
46_Text=The universe is so large. I don’t think we should try to understand everything.//<portrait=normal>Instead, we should strive for acceptance and contentment.
8_Text=There are wild mushrooms or berries by the park sometimes. I haven’t checked today, though.
138_Text=They need to increase the volume a bit, don’t you think, <PlayerName>$player</>?
135_Text=This sauce is delicious! I wonder what <NPCName>Frank</> puts in it.
121_Text=Though, you probably need to go to the other side of the island to dive.
24_Text=Too bad <NPCName>Betty</> doesn’t bake anymore.//<portrait=normal>I do miss her pastries sometimes.
43_Text=We donate what we can to Starlet Town. Mayor <NPCName>Connor</> is very grateful.
107_Text=We mix the dyes here ourselves. All organic, without any harsh chemicals.
4_Text=Well, aren’t you a delight! Thank you for the compliment.//<portrait=normal>I quite like my hair today.
36_Text=What a charming prospect!
101_Text=What a storm, huh?//How are we supposed to go on like this?
42_Text=YES! <NPCName>JIM</>! They look so alike.//<portrait=normal>The girl has her dad’s smile. Which is rare.
67_Text=You can improve your cooking skills by watching the cooking channel… But they show reruns sometimes. That’s a bit of a bummer, especially when you’re looking forward to a new recipe.
5_Text=You can put some fruit and vegetables on a grill, then drizzle some honey over them for a fantastic, colorful meal!
20_Text=You didn’t take off your boots.
94_Text=You don’t mind the rain, I see.
106_Text=You don’t mind the snow, I see.
100_Text=You don’t mind the storm, I see.
90_Text=You know, <PlayerName>$player</>, I’m going to complain less as part of my New Year’s resolution.//I have an excellent feeling about next year!
19_Text=You should take off your boots and be one with nature.//Take a deep breath…
130_Text=Your farm was neglected for a long time. You should have seen it! It wasn’t a pretty sight.//Mayor <NPCName>Connor</> was going to turn your grandparents farm into a community garden before you moved in.
129_Text=*furiously chopping vegetables*
64_Text=<NPCName>Archie</> told me that he learned about coral reefs and the island’s ecosystem from <NPCName>Betty</>.//I guess she probably knows this place better than anyone.
95_Text=<NPCName>Bree</>’s holding a yearly appreciation dinner for the mayor, where we’ll get to exchange gifts.
4_Text=<NPCName>Dippa</> is the one decorating my truck. I don’t have an eye for all this artsy stuff.//<portrait=happy>It’s something else, isn’t it?
58_Text=<NPCName>Erika</>? Hmm… I see her at school sometimes, but I don’t know where she might be today.
77_Text=<NPCName>Eva</>! We’ve made it a tradition to exchange gifts every year. It’s a little inside joke. Ha!
8_Text=<NPCName>Sam</> has a variety of items for sale. His place is one-stop shopping for the food truck.
139_Text=Ah, I should’ve packed an extra lunch.//<portrait=doubt>I ate mine too early, and I can feel my stomach growling again.
140_Text=Are you on a picnic too?
80_Text=But we also get a lot of cosmos… The flowers.//<portrait=normal>So I don’t want to complain too much about Summer.
25_Text=But when I do have leftovers, I refrigerate them to eat later.
49_Text=Did you know that the creek in front of the mayor’s house was once dried up? Oh, but it was so long ago… I doubt many people know about it.
53_Text=Did you know that the creek in front of the mayor’s house was once dried up?//Oh, but it was so long ago… I doubt many people know about it.
31_Text=Everything I sell is made fresh every day, by the way.//So you can be sure that you won’t be eating day-old meals.
72_Text=Everything is a mess! I can’t even find my old grill.
35_Text=Fishensips is just too loud for me.//<portrait=annoyed>The music hurts my ears, honestly.
48_Text=For some reason the kids don’t buy as much when I make anything else besides tacos.//<portrait=normal>Why is that, do you think?
78_Text=Going to the beach a lot, <PlayerName>$player</>?
16_Text=Grapes and rice can be fermented into alcoholic beverages in kegs. Did you know that?
12_Text=Grapes and rice can be fermented into alcoholic beverages in kegs.//Did you know that?
123_Text=Heading down to town, <PlayerName>$player</>?
17_Text=Hmm… I can’t remember who told me.//<portrait=normal>Why? Does it matter?
138_Text=Hmm… I may need to buy extra dyes today.
37_Text=Hmm… I seem to always run out of things.//Do I need to make a trip to Sam’s already?
132_Text=Hmm… What else do I need?
21_Text=I can’t believe it’s Sunday already. I’m still so tired from yesterday.//<portrait=normal>Maybe I can sneak in some beach time next weekend and lie out in the sun.
98_Text=I can’t remember the last time I changed the tires, to be perfectly honest. It’s worrisome if you ask me.
30_Text=I do my errands around Starlet Town on Wednesday or Thursday.//That way I can leave town on the weekend, if I need to.
26_Text=I don’t know why <NPCName>Dippa</> doesn’t just buy and sell art, you know?//<portrait=normal>They have an eye for it.
107_Text=I don’t like going out in the rain, so I usually just spend my day cooking.
33_Text=I don’t really like hanging out at Fishensips.//<portrait=normal>It’s too loud there.
97_Text=I don’t travel during the Winter. I’m afraid the truck might get stuck in the middle of a snowstorm.
24_Text=I don’t usually have any food left at the end of the day, because I don’t make a lot to begin with.
3_Text=I get my ingredients from <NPCName>Sam</>.//I also scavenge around the island for them.
6_Text=I get my ingredients from <NPCName>Sam</>.//I also use some vegetables that I grow in my garden.
9_Text=I go out of town sometimes. Not often, though, and usually only on weekends.
11_Text=I go out of town sometimes.//<portrait=normal>Not often, though, and usually only on weekends.
122_Text=I have no idea where this creek is flowing from… But I’m not one to explore nature, so I can never bring myself to find out.
89_Text=I have to scavenge extra hard during Winter because there’s not much around to begin with.
133_Text=I just buy my tortillas here. It takes too much time to make them from scratch.
135_Text=I might open my truck later.//<portrait=doubt>I don’t know yet.
110_Text=I need to crank up the heater in here.
41_Text=I need to make a list before I go to the store, or else I buy too much.//<portrait=annoyed>So annoying!
34_Text=I prefer the lake or just staying home… I hope you don’t think I’m dull!
137_Text=I put in some red cabbage, when it’s in season.//<portrait=happy>It has that nice crunchy texture.
87_Text=I remember the first Winter I opened my truck.//Almost the whole town showed up to celebrate with me.
63_Text=I see <NPCName>Betty</> at school often. I think she’s teaching the kids every week.//<portrait=happy>But I’m not 100 percent certain.
59_Text=I taught the kids a few tricks to make tacos. *laughs* I hope their parents don’t mind.
65_Text=I taught the kids at school a few tricks to make tacos. *laughs* I hope their parents don’t mind.
116_Text=I think I may take a quick walk later, before heading home.//You know, to enjoy the weather.
69_Text=I think I’m going to bring some tortillas to the Cherry Blossom Festival.//Do you think that’s tacky?
68_Text=If you find any wild fruit, feel free to take it, by the way.
93_Text=Isn’t there a saying that snow brings good luck?
111_Text=It feels like it was just snowing yesterday, and now it’s snowing again today.
50_Text=It was all so sudden when we had that earthquake. Then, bam! The creek was flowing again the next day.
54_Text=It was all so sudden when we had that earthquake.//<portrait=happy>Then, bam! The creek was flowing again the next day.
84_Text=It’s a lot of work being a mayor, you know.//Over the Summer I rarely caught him fishing at all, and he loves fishing.
70_Text=It’s always nice to gather with folks.
136_Text=It’s easier than you think to make good vegan tacos.//I personally like to use bell peppers, but you can use any Summer or Fall vegetables you want.
131_Text=It’s good to see you in such good spirits, <PlayerName>$player</>.
96_Text=It’s great, I suppose. It’s very nice of her to do that.//But it’s hard to find a good gift… I’m just not a great gift giver.
20_Text=It’s kind of nice to spend the weekend here.
109_Text=I’ll do it tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
125_Text=I’m glad you came to visit.
81_Text=I’m out of fish, so I guess I’m only selling vegan tacos tomorrow.
32_Text=I’m proud of that.
47_Text=I’ve been trying to cook something new to sell, like cookies or pizza.//But it’s easier said than done.
43_Text=I’ve been trying to cook something new to sell, like cookies or something.//But it’s easier said than done.
92_Text=I’ve been using a lot of substitutes lately.//<portrait=normal>I wonder if my customers even notice?
127_Text=Just had the time to do meal prep.//Ah, my hands are so dirty.
134_Text=Knowing where this fruit is grown helps me feel more connected to the island.//It also supports local farmers, right?
83_Text=Mayor <NPCName>Connor</> has been busy walking back and forth to town, lately.//I’m guessing he’s trying to get the Mooncake Festival ready.
27_Text=Me? Buying art? No, no. I don’t have what it takes…and I also don’t want to.//<portrait=happy>I like to keep moving all day.
128_Text=Might as well marinate some chard for burritos.
76_Text=My birthday is on the thirteenth, and do you know who else has a birthday on the thirteenth?
19_Text=My truck is closed today.//Probably wouldn’t get many customers, anyway.
20_Text=No offense.
88_Text=No, it wasn’t a gathering or anything like that.//<portrait=happy>They came to help out and probably wanted to boost my business.
82_Text=No, not a good time. I’ll go shopping for fish next week.//The vegetables will do for now.
36_Text=Oh sure, sure. I think a lot of people like that… The loud music and sweaty crowds.//<portrait=happy>It’s just not my type of place.
73_Text=Oh! It’s the last week of Spring already! I really need to find my old grill.
94_Text=Oh, is it the rain? Hmm… Maybe it is the rain.
57_Text=Oh, you look confused.//Looking for something, <PlayerName>$player</>?
99_Text=Please watch your boots. I’d hate to mop my floor again.
124_Text=Please watch yourself. Try not to step on anything, okay?
14_Text=School ends around 4 pm.//That’s usually my prime selling time.
85_Text=So lovely to see the Fall decorations in town.//They always do an excellent job.
1_Text=So the rumors were true after all. Welcome to town!//<portrait=doubt>We got a new scientist in town last month too. Can’t remember his name, though.//<portrait=normal>Anyway, I hope you like it here.
2_Text=Sure, sure, it’s nice to meet you too! My name is <NPCName>Emma</>.
5_Text=The kids love ’em.
108_Text=The storm may bring out more wild vegetables around the island.//I don’t know for sure, but it’s worth checking!
90_Text=The temperature is just too cold. Plants can’t survive in the snow.
86_Text=The whole town looks like a scene from a television show.
60_Text=They seemed to pick it up quickly, I have to say. I wonder if the kids already learned that somewhere else.
66_Text=They seemed to pick it up quickly, I have to say.//I wonder if the kids already learned that somewhere else.
15_Text=Usually… Not always, though.//Sometimes I’m lucky to sell five packs.
100_Text=Wah, the rain is that bad, huh?
106_Text=Wah, the storm is that bad, huh?
79_Text=We get a lot of bugs here over the Summer.//But there must be plenty over at the farm too, huh?//<portrait=doubt>I mean, the forest is right there.
71_Text=We’re halfway through Spring already and I haven’t done my house cleaning yet!
115_Text=What a great day to be outside.
112_Text=What luck, eh?
120_Text=When there are no customers I try to nap, and right now you’re kind of in the way.
103_Text=Wishful thinking on my part.
91_Text=With less wild produce around for me to cook with, I have to be very…creative when it comes to my taco recipe.
102_Text=With this rain, though, tomorrow there may be more wild fruit than usual around the island.
40_Text=Work, work, work… Eh, <PlayerName>$player</>?
75_Text=Yes. I am, in fact, one of these people.
67_Text=You can find all kinds of things around my house… Oh, like food, I mean!//<portrait=happy>There are wild mushrooms… Even fresh fruit sometimes.
118_Text=You can use any kind of fish to make fish tacos.//<portrait=happy>Honestly, after I cook the fish, I can’t even taste the difference. It’s all in the seasoning.
117_Text=You need a really good skillet to make tacos.
74_Text=You see, this is why we shouldn’t put things away.//Then people can’t see them, and people get irritated when they can’t find what they’re looking for.
140_Text=Can I tell you about my first date with Frank?
144_Text=Frank took me for a picnic. On the day, it was suddenly storming really hard... Storming just like this. But we didn’t wanna cancel the plan because it was our first date. I was curious about it. You know… When we got to the place, we stayed underneath a tree… To shelter. And he went on and on about some stories, trying to keep me interested.
141_Text=Oh, Good Fairies! Here comes a story.
35_Text= <NpcName>Ben</> gets around, you know. He usually disappears the last two weeks of Fall.//<portrait=surprised>Who knows where he goes to?
65_Text=*chuckles* Excuse me for prying.

174_Text=<NpcName>Betty</> said that’s the smell of good times and old friends.//I think she’s right.
70_Text=<NpcName>Charles</> does have red hair, but he also colors it red to keep it bright.
159_Text=<NpcName>Emily</> should really come here with me. We could have a chat over cheese.
68_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> has been the grill master for the past decade, so I think he would do that again this year…//Oh, you know, for the Cherry Blossom Festival.
14_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> is way too busy to clean up the lot next to the house.
103_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> said I would make a great detective.
179_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> works late often, so I usually get to hog the TV all night.
130_Text=<NpcName>Kenny</> mentioned that more animals get sick when it snows. Are your animals doing okay?
40_Text=<NpcName>Ling</> is your girl if you wanna know more about kelp, coral reef, and that stuff.//<portrait=happy><NpcName>Sunny</> and <NpcName>Jim</> can help with your fishing problem.//<portrait=normal>Hmm… What else… What else?

133_Text=Ahh! It’s so cold! I’m ready for summer.
172_Text=All right… Keep being you, <PlayerName>$player</>!
152_Text=And frankly, if I’m being honest, I forgot.//<portrait=happy>But it turned out to be one of <NpcName>Dippa</>’s favorite things!//<portrait=normal>I got lucky, I guess.
30_Text=And the blacksmiths make weapons. But you already know that…
41_Text=And the blacksmiths make weapons. You know that, right?
177_Text=Being an adult is mostly just washing dishes nonstop.

39_Text=Frankly, I don’t know who would do it, if Mayor <NpcName>Connor</> didn’t.//<portrait=normal>I certainly couldn’t! Too much responsibility for me.
77_Text=Has summer been kind to you, <PlayerName>$player</>? We left some food on the counter last night, and one of the cats ate it.
85_Text=Have you got one of those calendars in your house, <PlayerName>$player</>? You can keep track of people’s birthdays at your own convenience.
60_Text=Having a job, and all, leaves me little time to keep up with the neighbors.

96_Text=Here comes winter!
1_Text=Hey, you! Is <Italic>this</> our new neighbor?//<portrait=normal>Going around town, huh? Have you been to the tavern yet?//<NPCName>Frank</> is there all the time. Have you two met?
131_Text=Hopefully the cats won’t go out today. It’s way too cold for them.
141_Text=I always wonder why <NpcName>Bree</> didn’t purchase your grandparents' plot of land.//<portrait=surprised>She seems to be at the lookout area all the time. So she <Italic>clearly</> enjoys the view from up there.
148_Text=I can’t make everyone look good, <PlayerName>$player</>! I’m not a magician.
98_Text=I caught them trying to open the fridge door this morning. I’m not about to let that go.
146_Text=I don’t cook very well. Anything beyond a simple salad is out of my league.
36_Text=I don’t go to the lake or wherever. Places like that are just too quiet for me.
72_Text=I don’t gossip. I obtain and share information… So, sort of like the morning news.
95_Text=I don’t know what work event, <PlayerName>$player</>! I’m not a nosy person.
92_Text=I don’t know what work event, <PlayerName>$player</>! I’m not a nosy person. *winks*
139_Text=I don’t think they do anymore. They threw their back out or something.
88_Text=I have <NpcName>Ben</> looking out for some orchids this fall. I hope he comes through.
100_Text=I have some business to take care of on Saturday, so I can’t go. But I heard <NpcName>Sam</> and <NpcName>Emily</> are going then.
48_Text=I help clean up the community center.//The place is often empty. Who knows how much dust it accumulates.
104_Text=I know he was teasing me, but I don’t object. I think I would make a good detective.
102_Text=I know he was teasing me, but I have to agree with him. *chuckles* I was flattered.
34_Text=I love catching up with <NpcName>Ben</>. He always has some insightful things to say.
16_Text=I love kids…but my kids are my cats.//<portrait=happy>They’re the loves of our lives. You’ve seen them around, right? Aren’t they cute?
5_Text=I really can’t smell anything near the trash pit. The recycling is sorted correctly, so there shouldn’t be a strong smell.//I know this because I’m the one who sorts everything out.
7_Text=I really can’t smell anything near the trash pit.//I know the recycling is sorted correctly, so there shouldn’t be a strong smell.
123_Text=I should’ve worn my hat.
84_Text=I think I should eat some soup and lie down.
180_Text=I think I’ll go to bed soon…//It’s been a long day for me, I could use some extra sleep.
136_Text=I think I’ve gotten some wood chips inside my shoes.
156_Text=I think the tavern is the only other building as old as this one.
135_Text=I volunteer my time here once a week. Usually on Mondays.//I get fewer clients at the salon at the beginning of the week, so Mondays are perfect for me.
120_Text=I was so busy listening to his story, trying to make out what <NpcName>Frank</> was saying – mind you, it was storming! – that we both forgot to keep an eye on the picnic basket.//<portrait=surprised>It blew away! We had NO food.
32_Text=I wish I could cut my own hair, but <NpcName>Emily</> does just fine.
51_Text=I wouldn’t consider this a small town. There are so many people living here!
87_Text=If not, I guess a jar of jam will do.
71_Text=If you ask me, I say it’s because the poor thing wants to keep a bit of brightness in his life.
122_Text=It is one windy day! Protect your head, <PlayerName>$player</>.
173_Text=It smells a bit musky here, doesn’t it? Like sandalwood.
142_Text=It’s a mystery to me, because the lady has money.//<portrait=happy>But hey, at least now we have you.
54_Text=It’s always close to midnight when <NpcName>Frank</> gets home, but I still lock the door around eightish.
137_Text=It’s inevitable.//<portrait=concerned>Every time I walk here, wood chips… Wood chips! Wood chips!
124_Text=It’s so windy outside.
37_Text=I’ll totally lose my mind if I’m left alone with my thoughts for too long. *chuckles*
63_Text=I’m doing a public service to make sure we all know who our neighbors are. It’s not an easy job, you know. Never once have I been thanked.
73_Text=I’m doing a public service to make sure we all know who our neighbors are.//<portrait=annoyed>It’s not an easy job, you know. Never once have I been thanked.
97_Text=I’m going right back home as soon as I’m done with work. I have to keep an eye on the cats tonight.
83_Text=I’m going right back home as soon as I’m done with work. I’m feeling a bit ill today.
99_Text=I’m going to the Winter Fair on Sunday.
163_Text=I’m here to check on my friends and see what they’ve been up to.//<portrait=surprised>And, you know, to see what’s going on with <NpcName>Anthony</> lately.
157_Text=I’m here to promote my salon. Haircut, hair color. You know the drill.
140_Text=I’m just enjoying the weather. What are you doing, <PlayerName>$player</>? You seem to be in a rush.
144_Text=I’m merely enjoying the town. If there happens to be information I can pick up, that’s just a happy coincidence.
147_Text=I’m not looking forward to going home. Nobody did the dishes before we left this morning.//<portrait=normal>So the house is a huge mess right now.
176_Text=I’m not looking forward to going home. Nobody did the dishes this morning before we left.//<portrait=normal>So the house is a huge mess right now.
20_Text=Listen, <PlayerName>$player</>, people like gifts. Even if they don’t celebrate birthdays, they still like getting gifts.//Trust me!
28_Text=Looking gorgeous as usual – just like an iris!//<portrait=happy>Ah, I love irises. *winks*
160_Text=Make sure to check on <NpcName>Stephen</>! He is a delight…with his little claws.//So cute.
167_Text=My aunt told me that a long time ago, when she was a little girl, she and her friends used to watch the area near the villa at midnight to see if there actually was a ghost living there.
126_Text=My favorite winter spot is next to a fireplace.//Bet it’s yours too!
86_Text=My good friend <NpcName>Bree</>’s birthday is coming up. I’m gonna see if I have some jackfruit lying around. She loves that stuff.
43_Text=My goodness. The islanders are hard to keep up with!
52_Text=My goodness. The islanders are hard to keep up with!//<portrait=surprised>They always have things going on in their lives.
181_Text=My request?! You follow through.
172_Special=Nah Thanks though. I still have work.
118_Special=No, please don't tell me.
8_Text=Oh, for sure! Sometimes we forget to sort our recycling before tossing it into the bin.//<portrait=normal>That’s where I come in. I go through the bins now and then to make sure all the recycling is properly sorted.
115_Text=Oh, good fairies! Here comes a story.//<portrait=normal>He took me on a picnic. When the big day came, it was storming really hard.
3_Text=Oh, he’s my husband! You know what, you should stop by our house sometime…//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Frank’ll</> cook us dinner. Gosh! That sounds wonderful. Yes! You can tell us your story!
158_Text=Oh, imagine if people start coming to this island just to go to my salon!/<portrait=normal>Thinking about that makes me so excited!
62_Text=Oh, no no... I don’t gossip. I extract and share information...//<portrait=happy>YES! Sort of like the morning news.
55_Text=Oh, no, I’m not worried about break-ins. I just don’t want any visitors.//<portrait=normal>Besides, <NpcName>Frank</> has his own key, so he can let himself into the house whenever.
6_Text=Oh, you agree? Well… Maybe it’s just the smell of old plastic that people are complaining about.
118_Text=Oh, you silly goose! Of course, you wanna hear a story.//<portrait=surprised>Oh! Here comes a story. He took me for a picnic.//<portrait=normal>When the big day came, it was storming really hard.
178_Text=Once you sit down on one of these sofas, it’s hard to get up//<portrait=concerned>I get why these cats don’t like going outside.
61_Text=One time, while I was sick, everyone started going through these massive life changes. By the time I was back on my feet, there was a new scientist in town, a huge corporation was trying to drill up the island, and <NpcName>Valentina</>’s dad had missed a visit!
113_Text=Ooh… What are you doing here so late in the evening, <PlayerName>$player</>?
165_Text=Ooh… What are you doing here so often?
24_Text=People should always tell the truth, because keeping track of lies is hard. It’s easier to just be who we are.
66_Text=People should always tell the truth, because, gosh! Lies are hard to remember.//Also, I don’t wanna be caught spreading false information, here. My good name is on the line.
112_Text=Perfect weather for some spicy red curry!
111_Text=Rainy days make me so hungry for some reason. You too, yeah?
64_Text=Saw you at the beach last week, in and out of the inn? What were you doing, visiting the inn so often?
33_Text=She and <NpcName>Sam</> are the cutest couple. They’re such sweethearts!
94_Text=She said it was love at first sight. I don’t remember exactly how they met, but she told me it was some sort of work event.
106_Text=So annoying. I have things to do, you see. I can’t sit and eat all day.
78_Text=So now I’m just keeping an eye on <NpcName>Peanut</> and <NpcName>Butter</>. Hopefully nobody gets a tummy ache.
25_Text=So, have you got any of these truths for me, <PlayerName>$player</>? Let’s hear it.
53_Text=Sometimes I work on Sundays. If there’s nothing better to do, that is.
119_Text=Storming just like this. But we didn’t wanna cancel because it was our first date.//<portrait=normal>I was curious about him. You know…when we got to the picnic spot, we stayed underneath a tree…to stay dry.//And he went on and on telling stories, trying to keep me interested.
115_Special=Sure. Let's hear it!
19_Text=Talk to me, <PlayerName>$player</>. What’s going on with you today?
182_Text=Thank you, <PlayerName>$player</>. I know I can count on you. Dinner tonight is going to be special.
21_Text=That’s just the way things are around here.
4_Text=That’s one complicated way of answering…//<portrait=happy>Anyway, he’s super friendly.
50_Text=That’s right, I’m a busy girl, <PlayerName>$player</>!
4_Special=The bartender? Yes and no. Kind of. Depends on what you mean by “met.” Yes, I have seen him, but no, I haven’t actually spoken to him.
108_Text=The cats hate the rain. Now that I think about it, they don’t really like sunshine either. Hmm…
121_Text=The cats hate the rain.//Now that I think about it, they don’t really like sunshine either. Hmm…
69_Text=The man loves the job. It would probably break his heart, seeing other people doing it.
125_Text=The snow is kinda pretty, isn’t it?
132_Text=The snow makes everything look so clean.
89_Text=The thing about winter, though, is that not many people are out and about. It’s hard to socialize when we’re all cooped up inside our houses.
15_Text=The weeds just keep growing and growing. Dear goodness!//<portrait=annoyed>It’s like somebody’s been dumping fertilizer on them or something. If <NpcName>Noah</> weren’t so uptight, I would say he’s been pranking us.
155_Text=This building is old. As old as this town, I believe.//<portrait=happy>It does't show though, huh?
151_Text=This one time, I gave <NpcName>Dippa</> hot cocoa for their birthday because I didn’t have anything else ready.
171_Text=To <NpcName>Frank</>!
169_Text=Today is <NpcName>Frank</>’s birthday. *whispers* I got him a gift.//I’m gonna give the present to him later, when we get home.
110_Text=Ugh… I need to wash my shoes tomorrow.//<portrait=annoyed>They get super muddy! I hope it won’t be raining, though.
3_Special=Um, no. Who’s <NPCName>Frank</>?
109_Text=Watch your step! It’s super slippery.
46_Text=Well, not quite the weekend yet, but almost. It’s Thursday, which means tomorrow is Friday.
76_Text=Well, of course, I still volunteer at the school. Why wouldn’t I?
161_Text=What a smart idea to put a sewing machine out here, huh?//So kind.
47_Text=What do I do on the weekends? Hmm… That’s a great question.
31_Text=When one of my clients has a bad idea, I tell them.//I don’t want them walking around town with bad hair and people thinking it’s my fault!
153_Text=Who would’ve thought I would see you here! Of all places.
75_Text=With all this humidity, it’s going to be one sweaty summer for us.
168_Text=Yeah, this was before the villa was even built. My nana would get upset because Aunt <NpcName>Abel</> would stay up too late. Do you believe in that sort of stuff, <PlayerName>$player</>?
11_Text=Yikes!
67_Text=You can count on me for a good haircut.//So, if you ever want to change…umm…that, just drop by the salon.
145_Text=You can get really good at cooking just by watching the cooking channel. So many super easy recipes.
128_Text=You can still grow things like snowdrops and tea leaves, right?
138_Text=You know <NpcName>Dippa</>? The painter? They used to perform in some sort of acrobatic group.
93_Text=You know, <NpcName>Bree</> came from a big city, just like you… She had a fancy modeling job right before she married <NpcName>Walter</>.
10_Text=You must get a lot of trash on your farm, huh?//We live next to the beach, and so much trash blows right up to the front of our garage.
99_Special=festival
182_Special=sq017
203_Text=*shivering* I need to stand near the fireplace.//<portrait=sad>I’m not built for this type of weather.
266_Text=*sighs* I want to lead a life that’s worth telling stories about, too.
263_Text=<NpcName>Betty</> and I have this little ritual.//<portrait=normal>Every Sunday, one of us bakes a little cake, and we share it!
152_Text=<NpcName>Bree</> makes a delicious shredded jackfruit pie.//<portrait=happy>Oh, don’t worry! It’s vegan, in case you are.
233_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> and <NpcName>Betty</> still have the best red velvet cake in town, though.
51_Text=<NpcName>Macy</> is the one who has a cool pet lobster…not me.//Well, it’s not much of a pet, really. More like a rescue.//<portrait=happy>Pretty eccentric gal, she is.
52_Text=<NpcName>Macy</> loves pizza and wine.//She said they remind her of home.//I think she’s pretty close with her folks. She talks about home a lot.
213_Text=<NpcName>Sam</> always makes sure we only use the best ingredients.//He believes that people can taste quality, and I kind of agree with him on that.
214_Text=<NpcName>Sam</> is a great boss. He may seem off-putting at first, but he’s actually really kind.//<portrait=concerned>He is direct, though… Yeah.
250_Text=<NpcName>Sam</> needed a baker, I needed a job…//<portrait=happy>And here we are!
225_Text=<NpcName>Sam</>’s best quality is that he is direct. Other than that, he’s very…//<portrait=concerned>You know. Umm…
110_Text=<NpcName>Theo</> showed me a handful of jade a long time ago.//<portrait=happy>He told me he got it from an old treasure chest.
273_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, do you like the rain?//<portrait=normal>I do. It casts everything in a new light, and it smells great.
251_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, what’s your favorite kind of cookie?
239_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, you came from Pokyo, right? That’s so interesting! What was it like in the big city?
210_Text=A beautiful analogy to remind us not to judge one another, I think.
231_Text=A girl can dream, <PlayerName>$player</>.
77_Text=Ah, I see… I’m too scared to watch thrillers. <NpcName>Suki</> held a thriller party where we all watched this movie about a madman in a mask, raging around with a chainsaw, and I had to sleep with my lights on for two days.
234_Text=Ah, it’s nice to go out every once in a while and not have to cook.
79_Text=Ah, my kind of friend! I love romantic movies too. We should totally have a red velvet party and binge on rom-coms sometime.
102_Text=Also, I don’t want to buy ingredients for pies that nobody will eat, just to improve my baking skills.
96_Text=Also, I don’t want to buy ingredients for pies that nobody will eat, just to improve my baking skills.//Seems a tad wasteful to me.
22_Text=Also, I get to come out of the kitchen smelling like cookies.//<portrait=normal>Who doesn’t love that?!
269_Text=Although… Come to think of it, that’s not a bad idea!//<portrait=happy>I’ll talk to <NpcName>Sam</>.
278_Text=And it’s generally cheaper that way, too, which is a huge plus for me.
280_Text=And it’s wonderful to see that farm flourishing again.//<portrait=normal>You’re doing great.
72_Text=Are you done for the day?//I don’t know how big a workload farmers have.
236_Text=Are you foraging for wild mushrooms too?
117_Text=Are you going to plant flowers on your farm?//If you do, just don’t give any to <NPCName>Charles</>. He has some sort of pollen sensitivity.
26_Text=Aww… You were at Sam’s looking for me?//<portrait=annoyed>Oh no. Wednesday is my day off.
13_Text=Aww… You were at Sam’s looking for me?//<portrait=normal>Today is my day off, actually.
274_Text=Baking is a science as much as it is an art. It takes a lot of technical expertise to make the perfect bread.
276_Text=Baking pays the bills, but it’s also something I’m passionate about!//<portrait=happy>So that’s a win-win.
190_Text=Be careful out there. The path might be slippery.
138_Text=Better make sure my heater works. The inn’s central heating isn’t warm enough for me.//<portrait=surprised>Oh, but don’t tell <NPCName>Suki</>! She can be scary sometimes...
238_Text=But I’m grateful that I have all of you as my family.
275_Text=But don’t let that discourage you!//Learning from your mistakes is half the fun of it.
70_Text=Can your farm make truffle oil?//<portrait=happy>The mayor loves it, by the way. He said it’s the secret ingredient in <NpcName>Carol</>’s stew.
118_Text=Coral Island is just so beautiful in Spring. I’m glad I moved here.
61_Text=Decorative pillows are so expensive. That’s why I’m making my own.
237_Text=Do you ever feel like you’re doing a lot, but no matter what, it’s just not enough?
257_Text=Do you like to go to the library?//Even if you’re not much of a reader, <NpcName>Millie</> has a lot of great insights.
73_Text=Do you like to visit the museum?//I see you go in and out of there pretty often.
18_Text=Do you smell that? That's no perfume.//<portrait=normal>You’re smelling the cookies I baked.
5_Text=Do you think they’ll ever open another bakery in town?
201_Text=Does it snow back in Pokyo, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I’ve never been there.
86_Text=Err… No. I don’t sing if I don’t have to. I bet you sound good, though. I’ll have to hear you sometime.
133_Text=Fall is one of the reasons I decided to move here. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.//<portrait=happy>And who wouldn’t want to wake up to see that every day?
129_Text=Fall is so pretty, isn’t it? Back home, the trees never looked like this.
43_Text=For some reason I always crave red velvet cake on Fridays.//<portrait=normal>You know, maybe it’s a celebratory thing. Maybe…//<portrait=annoyed>In my mind, red velvet cake marks the end of the week.//I don’t know.
194_Text=Going somewhere?//Nobody likes getting wet. Please excuse me.
253_Text=Good choice! I’ll have to remember that.
222_Text=Growing up, my parents told me that if you have people who care about you, you have a good life.
127_Text=Have you seen those cute little white flowers growing everywhere?//What are those? I think they’re daisies.//Are they daisies, you think?
23_Text=Hello, neighbor!//Another Wednesday, eh?
44_Text=Hmm… Do you think there’s, like, a green velvet cake?//<portrait=happy>Should I try making one with lettuce?//<portrait=annoyed>Doesn’t sound very appealing, to be honest.
92_Text=Hmm… Let’s see. Pineapple upside-down cake, pumpkin pies, doughnuts! Hmm… What else?
8_Text=Hmm… Yeah, there are plenty of trees and rocks for them to take shelter under.//<portrait=sad>You’re right.//But still.
104_Text=How’s your first Spring on Coral Island so far?
176_Text=I always get all sappy during Winter. Argh…
211_Text=I always get all sappy during Winter. Aww…
91_Text=I can bake more things, you know. Not just cookies and bread.
169_Text=I can only imagine how cozy the nights are at the farm, this time of year. What a perfect way to end your day.
167_Text=I can only imagine how misty it gets in the morning at the farm, this time of year. What a perfect way to start your day.
95_Text=I can’t just start baking a whole bunch of cakes and pies at the inn.//I mean, who’s going to eat them?
116_Text=I can’t wait for the Cherry Blossom Festival. It’ll be so much fun. I might try my luck with balap karung this year… I don’t know! Maybeeeee!
170_Text=I don’t eat out much. I don’t know… I guess the dishes that I actually love, I can make myself.
232_Text=I don’t eat out much.//I don’t know… I guess the dishes that I actually love, I can make myself.
268_Text=I don’t have any free samples.//<portrait=concerned>We don’t do that here...sorry!
200_Text=I don’t know why I keep telling you that. Oops.
85_Text=I don’t really know <NpcName>Zarah</> that well. She loves cookies, though.//She buys them in bulk.
228_Text=I don’t really like tidying up.//It’s a waste of time, and let’s face it, it’s going to get messy again anyway.
54_Text=I don’t think I could ever do that…//<portrait=sad>Not brave enough.
137_Text=I don’t think I’ll ever get bored with snow. I didn’t grow up with it, so I always find it mesmerizing.
7_Text=I feel so awful for stray animals…//<portrait=sad>I wish we could build them little houses in the woods.
53_Text=I gotta say, I envy your courage for taking a leap of faith.//<portrait=concerned>You moved to an island and totally changed career paths.
122_Text=I grew up with this type of weather…hot and humid basically all year long.//So yeah, I’m used to it, but working in front of the oven in this weather is still…something.
66_Text=I had a slice of bread for a quick breakfast this morning.//That and some fruit from the kitchen.
135_Text=I hardly ever baked pumpkin pies until I moved here. I was missing out!
227_Text=I have extra food in the kitchen if you’re hungry.
15_Text=I have lots of dreams. I don't know where to begin.//<portrait=normal>For instance, I would love to open my own bakery someday. Once I master pies and cakes.
100_Text=I haven’t planned it yet.
197_Text=I hope I can borrow a couple of extra blankets tonight from <NPCName>Suki</>.
143_Text=I kind of want to play in the snow in the park with the kids. <NPCName>Valentina</> always looks like she’s having so much fun playing outside.
156_Text=I know… I know… I sound like a brat, but it gets so humid, my hair doubles in size.
145_Text=I know… I know…//<portrait=concerned>I sound like a brat, but it gets so humid, my hair doubles in size.
14_Text=I like to spend my days off hanging around in the park, or hiking somewhere pretty.
259_Text=I like to take inspiration from the beach sometimes.//<portrait=happy>The shells, the sea… So much material.
258_Text=I like to visit just to get her talking about something.//She seems so chill, but she can get really fired up.
158_Text=I love Summer, but I’m ready for it to cool down a little.
46_Text=I love how <NpcName>Betty</> and I can just talk and talk about baking…//And red velvet.//Turns out we have a lot in common!
267_Text=I love it here.//<portrait=normal>It’s so peaceful…but so full of life, too.
136_Text=I love snow, you know. It’s so fascinating the way it’s soft and fluffy but also cold and clumpy.//It feels magical.
160_Text=I love summer, but I’m ready for it to cool down a little.
28_Text=I love the lake in Winter, when everything is rigid and frozen.//It looks so clean and pretty.//Mesmerizing to look at.
270_Text=I love the way Sam’s smells. Most stores smell weird, but we keep this place spick-and-span!
89_Text=I love to read about traveling, to learn what the world is like out there. Maybe one day I’ll go and see for myself.
224_Text=I mean, look at this town…//<portrait=happy>We have a tavern right there.//The beach is that way…//<portrait=normal>And we have a fully stocked library right there.
126_Text=I might enter the swimming contest next week. It’ll be fun, even if I’m not a great swimmer. Especially compared to <NPCName>Sunny</>!//<portrait=surprised>He doesn’t move that fast when he’s walking!
106_Text=I often find wasabi sprouting this time of year, near the lake.//<portrait=happy>Have you found any yet?
32_Text=I opened my window this morning, and the mist woke me right up.
119_Text=I prefer Spring to Summer… But if we’re talking favorites, it would definitely be Winter.//It’s more bearable working in front of the oven in Winter.
59_Text=I sew after work.//Ah, for fun. The inn has a community sewing machine in the lobby, so why not?
99_Text=I think I’ll go see <NpcName>Betty</> at the Tavern tomorrow. Why?
279_Text=I think having a new face has been good for Starlet.//Fresh perspectives make everything better.
141_Text=I usually don’t notice how much heat the oven at <NPCName>Sam’s</> radiates until it’s Summer.//<PlayerName>$player</>, it’s really hot!
134_Text=I want to bake some pumpkin pies. Might as well since they’re in season, right?
69_Text=I work from noon to five on Sundays.//What about you?
47_Text=I work regular hours today.//No big deal, though. I like baking.
243_Text=If you could travel anywhere in the world, what would you do first?
261_Text=Isn’t the lake beautiful in winter?//So placid… So still.
128_Text=Isn’t this the best season for cookies and tea?
199_Text=It doesn’t snow back home… Umm…
131_Text=It is a bit chilly right now, but I much prefer it to the heat of Summer.
241_Text=It sounds amazing. I bet you’d be a great tour guide!
271_Text=It’s a shame to stay inside all day, with weather like this.//<portrait=concerned>But I’m so busy, what choice do I have?
207_Text=It’s either fluffy or slippery this time of year. You really have to be careful going back, <PlayerName>$player</>.
132_Text=It’s getting colder, isn’t it? I guess it’s a sign Winter is just around the corner.
198_Text=It’s getting late, <PlayerName>$player</>. You should really go home and rest.
189_Text=It’s getting late, <PlayerName>$player</>.//You should really go home and rest.
264_Text=It’s important to have friends who share your interests, and to always make time for them.
193_Text=It’s nice and warm here.//Hmm…
125_Text=It’s not bad living at the inn, the second floor especially… Yeah, it does get really hot in Summer because of the broken air conditioner.//But after sunset, you open the window, and the salty breeze is just divine!
277_Text=I’m a real believer in the power of DIY.//It’s so fulfilling to make things yourself!
37_Text=I’m glad <NpcName>Randy</> is fighting to keep our school open, even though we only have four students.
155_Text=I’m grateful for everything that I have, but living by the sea isn’t as fun as it sounds… Especially in Summer.
144_Text=I’m grateful for everything that I have, but living by the sea isn’t as fun as it sounds…//Especially in Summer.
215_Text=I’m making fruit tart today.//I used fresh blueberries, but you can use literally any fruit.

112_Text=I’m not sure if you noticed, but the grass changes color a bit in Summer.//Nature is beautiful, isn’t it?
161_Text=I’m so ready for some green tea and cookie weather.
223_Text=I’m starting to see what they meant.
168_Text=I’m turning on my heater tonight. It’s starting to get too cold for me. The central heat at the inn just isn’t cutting it.
249_Text=I’ve always been interested in baking!//I only started doing it professionally a few years ago, though.
50_Text=I’ve tried copying <NpcName>Frank</>’s red velvet cakes many times, but mine are never as good…
63_Text=Just working… Then I’ll watch some TV, then rest.//<portrait=concerned>Sounds so dull when I say it out loud.
38_Text=Let’s just hope the government doesn’t close down the school the first chance they get.
60_Text=Many things… But I mostly sew decorative pillows.//<portrait=happy>They’re gorgeous and easy to make.
68_Text=Maybe farming…or swimming with dolphins.//<portrait=normal>Go hiking up the mountain and see the stars up close. I haven’t done any of those things just yet.
90_Text=Maybe, maybe, maybe… With the never-ending bills, it’s hard to know when that might be.
157_Text=My favorite festivals are the Animal Festival and Harvest Festival!//I like the Cherry Blossom Festival potluck too. It’s just that it’s always held so early in Spring. It’s still so cold to be outside all day.
57_Text=Not just energy.//It takes a lot of patience and dedication, I’m sure.
235_Text=Now, this is my kind of music!
83_Text=Oh gosh. I keep running into you, <PlayerName>$player</>. What a fun thing to happen!
75_Text=Oh gosh. I keep running into you, <PlayerName>$player</>. What a fun thing to happen.

192_Text=Oh my! Stop teasing.//Not a joke, I was being serious.
196_Text=Oh my.
180_Text=Oh yes! A party where we all can eat fancy food and sip fine drinks. Oh, and everybody has a great time. That would be fabulous.
78_Text=Oh yes! We should watch a stand-up comedian together sometime.
33_Text=Oh! I just love your style!//<portrait=normal>I like to pay attention to people’s outfits around here. You know, for inspiration.
98_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>! It’s you again. How fun.
19_Text=Oh, I don’t mind at all! I love baking.//<portrait=normal>Besides, I get to keep some of them for myself.
6_Text=Oh, I’m not scared!//<portrait=normal>I think it would be amazing. I’d love to meet other bakers.
153_Text=Oh, almost forget to mention.//<portrait=normal>Did you know that you can find shallots around the lake this time of year?
166_Text=Oh, come on! You’re telling me that you’ve never gone out of your way to find a pile of crunchy leaves, just to step on them?
74_Text=Oh, gotcha. Me neither… It’s too quiet for my taste.//<portrait=concerned>It would put me right to sleep.
1_Text=Oh, nice to meet you too!//<portrait=happy>My name’s <NPCName>Everest</>…//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Eva</> for short.
244_Text=Oh, that sounds amazing! Conservation is so important, too, especially in this day and age. Good pick!

240_Text=Oh. Well, um, I’m glad you’re here now!
71_Text=Oh… Haven’t you heard? <NpcName>Carol</> is Mayor <NpcName>Connor</>’s late wife.//<portrait=sad>May she rest in peace.
242_Text=Oh… ha ha. I can understand that.
265_Text=Older people have the most amazing stories! I suppose when you live that long, it’s bound to happen.
179_Text=One day I want to throw fancy parties, like <NpcName>Bree</>’s annual dinner parties. Ah, you know! With a dress code and an elaborate theme, and stuff.
246_Text=Ooh, I’m hungry just thinking about that. Great pick!
113_Text=Peonies are the prettiest flower in the world, don’t you think?//<portrait=normal>Their blossoms are so large, and their colors are blindingly vivid.
94_Text=Practice does make perfect. Maybe if <NpcName>Sam</> starts selling other things, like pies, I can finally get good at baking pies too.
247_Text=Really? I can’t imagine not wanting to see the world…but okay.
254_Text=Really? Me too! Red velvet everything for me, forever.
49_Text=Red velvet cakes at Fishensips is so yum!//I don’t know what I would do if <NpcName>Frank</> stopped making red velvet cakes.

62_Text=So true, decorative pillows are impractical.//<portrait=normal>But they look so pretty on the furniture! Can’t help myself.
229_Text=Someday I want to have a big house, with a big kitchen to chop vegetables in. You know?!
221_Text=Starlet is such a beautiful town, and I think people truly care about each other here.//<portrait=happy>I can feel it.
45_Text=Sundays are special for me.//<portrait=happy>I hang out at the Tavern with <NpcName>Betty</> after work. Girls’ night in…//Just a couple of bakers, chatting the night away.
124_Text=The Beach Cleanup Festival is right in front of the inn.//I wake up to people getting the festival ready…on the 27th of Summer, of course! Not today. Ha ha!
130_Text=The Harvest Festival here is so cool.//It’s nothing like the one we had when I was growing up.
212_Text=The baked goods here are freshly baked every day.//Don’t you worry, <PlayerName>$player</>. I can vouch for this because I bake them myself.
109_Text=The beach is still a little cold.//Have you ever found anything pretty, diving here?//<portrait=surprised>You have?!
149_Text=The best is when I find jackfruit.//<portrait=normal>I always share some with <NpcName>Bree</>, the wine lady. She loves to make a fancy meal out of it.
24_Text=The food here is so yum.//Lodeh, popiah, fried rice… I have to teach myself to make those, one of these days.
39_Text=The food here makes me miss my parents.//Ah, you too, huh?
121_Text=The inn doesn’t have a working air conditioner.//It sort of turns on and off by itself sometimes. My room can get pretty hot.
165_Text=The leaves were so crunchy when I walked to work this morning. They were so satisfying to step on.
256_Text=The smell of fresh baked goods can really liven up a place.
115_Text=The snow melts so fast.//It’s already gone, and Spring just started!
10_Text=The vineyard view alone! Wow!//<portrait=happy>And right next to the community center.
272_Text=The weather report said it would be raining all day…//<portrait=concerned>And it was right! It’s still going out there.
67_Text=There are still things I want to see in this world.//Like, I’m sure there’s more to life than baking cookies.
48_Text=There’s nothing else I can do around here, anyway. So I might as well bake.//<portrait=happy>Besides, baking is fun.
139_Text=These are the days when I’m super glad I’m a baker. I have my own personal heater at work!
204_Text=Today was a long day! With the snow and all.//<portrait=sad>Good gosh.
114_Text=Too bad they only bloom in Spring.
55_Text=Ugh, sorry. I don’t know why I said that.//I hope I didn’t bum you out.
80_Text=Ugh… My room is such a mess right now. I should clean it up.
97_Text=Ugh… So much negativity. Sorry for attacking you like that, <PlayerName>$player</>.
226_Text=Umm… <NpcName>Sam</> is straightforward, honest.//<portrait=annoyed>Frank, direct.//Did I say direct already?
27_Text=Umm… No baking for me today.//<portrait=normal>I would rather spend my day off hanging around in the park, or knitting something pretty.
84_Text=Unless she needs to pick up some groceries, I rarely see <NpcName>Zarah</> in the shop.//It seems she’s not a big vegetable buyer, either, ’cause I mostly see her buying a bunch of flour and oil.
2_Text=We don’t see too many new faces, so your arrival is great for the town.
93_Text=Well, if I had to choose, cookies are probably my best baked goods. I make them all the time, so I think I might have maxed out my cookie-baking skills.
58_Text=What are you up to, <PlayerName>$player</>?
120_Text=What do you think would be the perfect baked good for Spring?//<portrait=happy>For me, probably something colorful like a fruit tart. So yum!
9_Text=What if someone built a big mansion where the recycling center is?
76_Text=What type of movies do you like?
260_Text=What’s your farmhouse like inside?//<portrait=happy>I’d love to see it sometime!//<portrait=normal>You can learn a lot about someone from their home.
148_Text=When I have the time, I’ll forage around the woodlands for some fresh Summer veggies and flowers.
177_Text=When the snow blankets the town like this, it’s hard to tell the buildings apart. Until you go inside, you don’t know whose house it really is.

195_Text=Why do rainy nights always make me feel sooooo melancholy…
142_Text=Winter is the perfect time to slow down a little…//Reflect on the year and stuff.
262_Text=Winter makes everything look so different, doesn’t it?
111_Text=With Summer right around the corner, it must be a busy period for you as a farmer, huh?
245_Text=Wow, what I wouldn’t give… Those shows must be breathtaking. Good pick!
206_Text=Wow… With snow like this, you can really see everyone’s footprints!//Which ones are yours?

248_Text=You must have a really interesting perspective on the world!//<portrait=happy>You went from a big city to a farm on an island, and all that.
30_Text=<NPCName>Leah</>’s trying to make it big on the internet.//Don’t ask me. I don’t know what it means either.//<portrait=normal>Sometimes she asks if she can record me cooking…for “content,” she says.
42_Text=<NPCName>Noah</> and I used to run around the island, terrorizing our parents together.

50_Text=<NPCName>Noah</>’s had glasses since grade school.//You know, you seem to be asking a lot of questions about <NPCName>Noah</>.//Interesting!
128_Text=A glass of green tea or a healthy salad?
134_Text=Ah, sorry. Forgot I already asked that.//<portrait=normal>Guess I’m a little preoccupied.
131_Text=Ah, this one right here is vintage...this furniture.
91_Text=Ah… I’m in a pickle, aren’t I?
61_Text=Book-keeping is not my strength. It is extremely tedious for my taste.
53_Text=Bookkeeping isn’t one of my strengths.//<portrait=annoyed>It’s just so tedious.
45_Text=But as soon as I graduated, I knew I needed to come back.//I felt like I didn’t belong in the big city, you know?//Was never home to me.
51_Text=Can you say frankly when your name is <NPCName>Frank</>?

80_Text=Every time he comes to Fishensips, he’s always asking for it.//The fruit, tarts, what else? Hmm.
2_Text=Folks at the tavern have been talking about you.//You should stop by sometime.
103_Text=Go ahead. Ask me about my day!//<portrait=happy>My day has been great, thanks for asking!
93_Text=Gotta say a drizzle comes as a pleasant surprise in this heat.
107_Text=Gotta say it is a pleasant surprise to get some drizzle in this heat.
126_Text=Ha ha… Kidding, <PlayerName>$player</>. Too early for a bad joke?
127_Text=Have a seat, <PlayerName>$player</>! What are you standing up for?
132_Text=Having lots of customers is great, but the downside is that the patio is always dirty.
97_Text=Heh heh… You got me! I’m hiding from the rain in here.
108_Text=Heh heh… You got me!//<portrait=happy>I’m hiding from the rain in here.

94_Text=Heh, heh… You got me! I’m hiding from the rain in here.
29_Text=Hello, hello, hello!
20_Text=Hmm… Maybe I can get <NPCName>Theo</> to sing with me.
74_Text=I bet it’s because he doesn’t want to clean them off.//<portrait=happy>I won’t lie to you, <PlayerName>$player</>, cleaning mushrooms is the worst part about cooking them. But that boy <NPCName>Noah</> is just lazy! Ha ha.
14_Text=I can’t imagine living anywhere but here.//But I do miss the city every now and then.
23_Text=I cook at home.//<portrait=happy>I love it, and frankly, I’m good at it! Ha!

130_Text=I feel good today!
41_Text=I guess I grew out of it…

63_Text=I just hope they don’t drill here.
48_Text=I learned to cook from my mother. But I didn’t actually cook cook until I went away to college.//I didn’t have much choice. I missed my mom’s food, and I was just too far from home.
44_Text=I left the island to go to college some years ago.//It was a fun time.
117_Text=I like cooking and hosting. I feel like my biggest competitor on this island is <NPCName>Bree</>.//She throws great dinner parties.
66_Text=I need to brush my grill today. Tomorrow is the potluck barbecue already.
99_Text=I suppose I can just chill for the day.
81_Text=I tend to sell more pasta dishes in Fall. I wonder why?

95_Text=I thought I could spend my free time here, but it doesn’t seem like there’s anything that needs doing.
19_Text=If somebody asked, sure, I’d sing.//I mean, why the heck not!!
27_Text=If you surround yourself with positive people, soon enough, positivity will be second nature.
8_Text=It really is a waste of time to clean up.//Maybe if I turn it into a garden, other people will help keep it up. I’m too busy to do it all alone.
88_Text=It’s even hard for us to walk!

65_Text=I’ll be the proud grill master for the day. Heh, heh.
16_Text=I’m always trying out new recipes for the Tavern, so make sure to visit often.//You really don’t want to miss anything!
122_Text=I’m having computer problems.//Remind me to ask <NPCName>Lily</> to take a look at it, will ya?
101_Text=I’m not too worried about the rain. Give it a day or so and I’m sure it’ll stop.

58_Text=My brother takes care of a lot of the back end of things, running the Tavern.
56_Text=My brother takes care of most of the back-of-the-house things, running Fishensips.
133_Text=My mom’s full name is <NPCName>Beatrice</>. And mine is <NPCName>Franklin</>, after Dad. Is <PlayerName>$player</> your full name?
120_Text=My tavern is your tavern, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>What can I get you today?

114_Text=So you’ve come to the right place. Heh, heh!
124_Text=Stop by for some fresh drinks?
22_Text=Sure, I use recipes, but I mix my own drinks at the bar sometimes.//No complaints so far.
125_Text=Thank Goddess, there isn’t a health code or anything here, or else they’d shut me down so fast.
5_Text=The Tavern is pretty old. I hope the town doesn’t ever tear it down to build some shiny new one.//That's why we keep trying our best to take a good care of it...repainting the building and all.
25_Text=The cost of living is really low in Coral Island.//I don’t think you need to make a lot to live comfortably.

227_Text=<NPCName>Kira</> is better at this than I am.//You should find her if you need help with yoga poses.
166_Text=<NPCName>Kira</> isn’t a picky eater. I don’t think she loves or hates any particular foods.//She sure loves flowers, though.
199_Text=<NPCName>Kira</> never did mind going out in the rain. Me… I’m a little different.
172_Text=<NPCName>Kira</> said I ought to spend time at the Tavern making new friends.//She thinks it would be good for me.
96_Text=<NpcName>Ben</>. That kid just got back from his journey, doing who knows what.

204_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, have you seen my coffee cup?//I swear I left it around here somewhere.
32_Text=After all this time, <PlayerName>$player</>. It still confuses you, eh?
28_Text=Ah, never mind.//<portrait=concerned>It would be way too much work to transport all my animals… Not like I would ever have the guts to tell my parents about abandoning their ranch, anyway.
135_Text=Ah, you’ve never had one of these visits either?//That makes me feel a tad better.
150_Text=Are you doing okay, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Let me or <NPCName>Kenny</> know if you need anything.

23_Text=Do you have enough fodder for the week, <PlayerName>$player</>?
161_Text=Do you need something from the ranch? It isn’t urgent, is it?//<portrait=normal>Oh, good! Then let’s just wait until tomorrow.
165_Text=Do you prefer sweet or savory foods?//<portrait=surprised>I like them all… Kimchi, fruit tarts… ANY fruit tarts!
134_Text=Do you think it’s because he trusts me more than other businesses?//<portrait=concerned>Or does he just forget because I live in the woods?
19_Text=Don’t camp in this forest.//Listen to me on this.
167_Text=Don’t worry about getting me anything for my birthday.//<NPCName>Kira</> and I don’t celebrate birthdays.
111_Text=Especially in such beautiful weather as this.
93_Text=Fall is when we get busy, with cooking contest coming up.//A lot of preparation for me.
190_Text=Fall means harvest season, and harvest season means good food!//I can’t decide what to cook first!
127_Text=Fancy seeing you here, <PlayerName>$player</>. Buying or selling?
193_Text=Fresh veggies are hard to come by in the Winter.//I might wait until Spring to try out new recipes again.
66_Text=Gah. I sounded like <NpcName>Kenny</> just now… That was weird.
22_Text=Good customer service, isn’t it?
95_Text=Guess who’s back in town?
175_Text=Has <NPCName>Kenny</> taught you about animals’ moods yet?//I bet he has. So, your chickens and stuff will get upset if you don’t feed them.
152_Text=Have you ever tried yoga? It’s a surprisingly good workout.//<portrait=surprised>Oh! You’re a yogi! No way!
117_Text=Have you fed your animals today?
225_Text=Have you seen my coffee cup?//I know I set it down somewhere.
194_Text=Have you stored up enough food for Winter?//It’s hard to cook if you don’t have the right ingredients.
62_Text=Have you watched this week’s cooking show?//They’re very informative, and you learn a new skill every time.
2_Text=Having another rancher can be good for the local economy. We might be able to produce local cheese again.
46_Text=Heh… Why am I giving you fitness advice?
202_Text=Hot meals are great on days when the weather’s bad.//What should I cook for dinner tonight?
14_Text=How are you?
226_Text=How do you organize your farm, <PlayerName>$player</>? You should tell me about it sometime.//We can trade organization tips.
20_Text=I almost became somebody’s lunch, years ago, because I fell asleep by the creek.//<portrait=normal>Good thing, <NpcName>Kira</> was there to scare off the bear.
24_Text=I always say, it’s never bad to have extra.
44_Text=I am so energized!//A new man, if you will.
33_Text=I assign myself a day off, usually on Saturdays.//I’m pretty strict about it.
144_Text=I don’t mind him playing his flute, but he should get his work done first.
147_Text=I don’t mind, though.//<portrait=normal>It gives me more time to check the shop’s inventory. Someone’s gotta do it, right?
128_Text=I don’t shop here often, because we usually cook with fruit and vegetables from our garden.
122_Text=I don’t think I have anything to worry about. He’s a gentle soul, and those animals have special place in his heart.
30_Text=I don’t think I should go to Starlet Town today.//I’m busy. Are you heading there?
124_Text=I feel like it sounds a bit daunting when you tell yourself that you need to exercise.
8_Text=I find cooking very relaxing… And, better yet, you get to eat the result!
90_Text=I had an apple for breakfast this morning.
157_Text=I had no idea food could blow up like that! But it’s okay, though.//<portrait=happy>We’re all learning, am I right?//<portrait=normal>As long as we have fun and don’t give up. That’s the key to successful cooking.
57_Text=I have a meeting at the community center tomorrow after work.
133_Text=I hear the mayor often visits businesses around the island. Keeping track and all that.//<portrait=concerned>But I’ve never once had one of these visits.
79_Text=I hope I don’t get sick before the beach cleanup this Saturday.
212_Text=I hope nothing gets damaged in this storm.//We can’t really afford to repair the ranch.
206_Text=I hope this rain is over by morning.//It gets pretty muddy up around here.
214_Text=I hope this storm is over by morning.//It gets pretty flooded out there.
13_Text=I join a yoga class every Saturday at the community center.//What do you usually do on the weekend?
136_Text=I keep an eye on the animals every single day.
72_Text=I know they would do the same for me, if our roles were reversed.
182_Text=I like Spring. It’s easier to get fresh ingredients this time of year.//<portrait=surprised>Spring and Summer… And don’t forget Fall.//<portrait=annoyed>Hmm… Hang on. That’s basically the whole year.
37_Text=I like taking care of animals and cooking, but I prefer my animals.//<portrait=concerned>Besides, who else is going to do it?
51_Text=I name the animals at the ranch after Summer crops. Melon, Poppy, Radish.
209_Text=I need to get out of this before I get hurt.//Being struck by lightning is no joke.
98_Text=I saw <NpcName>Taco</> in here the other day. He went inside the barn and played with the cows.
39_Text=I should get my nose checked.
162_Text=I should have done inventory last night, but I got caught up watching the cooking show.//<portrait=surprised>Wow! That show can hypnotize you for hours!
183_Text=I should probably restock the ranch’s feed supply.//Everyone stocks up on feed in the Spring.
6_Text=I spend a lot of time at the ranch managing the shop’s supplies, making sure we have enough to sell.//That sort of thing.
130_Text=I think I’ll make some soup tonight. Nice and warm. Yum…
132_Text=I think I’ll take a nap for a bit, after you leave.
52_Text=I think they’re beautiful names.//Not <NpcName>Betsy</>, <NpcName>Kenny</> named her that.
121_Text=I told <NpcName>Kenny</> that when I can’t do it anymore, he needs to be the one who takes care of these animals.
156_Text=I tried to cook a big dinner for the whole family last night.//<portrait=happy>If you heard <NPCName>Kenny</> shouting all the way over at your place, that was probably why.
188_Text=I try and stick to shady areas on my way to work in the mornings.//<portrait=surprised>I might melt if I spend too much time in the sun.
9_Text=I wash my hair every day. A habit, really, rather than a necessity.//<portrait=happy>Thankfully I don’t have that much hair, so it isn’t a big deal.
50_Text=I'm so energized!//A new man, if you will.
36_Text=If I weren’t a rancher like my dad, I would be a chef.
120_Text=If you and I are cold, it stands to reason that your pet might be cold too.
196_Text=If you need a warm place to rest during your errands, come by the ranch.//I keep it nice and toasty in there.
143_Text=If you see <NPCName>Kenny</>, would you tell him to come to find me?//<portrait=concerned>He forgot to feed one of the cows.
198_Text=If you’re looking for <NPCName>Kenny</>, he’s probably inside the house.
123_Text=Inhale the future, exhale the past.
41_Text=Is it really that strong? I should get my nose checked.
192_Text=It also makes <NPCName>Kenny</>’s flute go out of tune. Someone should probably tell him that.//<portrait=happy>Me? No… Maybe you should do it. You two are friends, aren’t you?
219_Text=It feels weird to have guests, let me tell you.//<portrait=happy>In a nice way, though… Weird nice.
139_Text=It leaks a bit in the rain, but it doesn’t rain that often here. So, no big deal.//But I thought I should mention it up front.
100_Text=It must be hard to enter the cooking contest with so few fresh options on hand.
118_Text=It’s gloomy out. Our animals could use a little extra love… Just saying. No need to get defensive.
99_Text=It’s hard to get fresh vegetables during the Winter… Good thing we have some stocked up in the kitchen.//<portrait=concerned>But that won’t last us too long, I’m afraid.
158_Text=It’s nice to walk slowly and take in all of the island’s sights.//There’s no reason to go too fast.
94_Text=It’s probably your busiest season as well, huh?
179_Text=It’s rough when rude customers come to the ranch.//It’s not everyone, or even most people. It’s just a few prickly individuals.
205_Text=It’s time to make something hot to eat! What should I cook?
207_Text=I’ll have to do my yoga indoors this evening. It doesn’t look like the rain’s going to let up.
174_Text=I’ll have to look for more animal feeds to stock.//<portrait=happy><NPCName>Ben</> is helpful with this type of work.//<portrait=normal>He’s young and gathers feed quickly… Which is weird, ’cause he walks really slow.
215_Text=I’ll have to make something hot for dinner tonight.//Have any suggestions?
154_Text=I’m curious what stories people have told you about <NPCName>Kira</>.//My wife is a bit of a legend around here.
80_Text=I’m feeling a bit under the weather.
173_Text=I’m from here, so I know a lot of these folks already.//<portrait=normal>But I don’t know them as well as my parents do.
187_Text=I’m glad <NPCName>Kira</>’s not out hunting anymore.//Not that I don’t think she could handle it. It’s the heat!
203_Text=I’m glad I’m not out in that rain.//My groceries can wait. I’m not going to Sam’s in this weather.
114_Text=I’m just glad I’m still here to make sure the animals are dry and healthy.
141_Text=I’m pretty sure these barns are listed in a library book somewhere, as some of the island’s oldest buildings.
87_Text=I’m trying to collect as many coconuts as possible before Summer ends.//I might go to the beach again tomorrow and see if I can get some more.
1_Text=Just call me <NPCName>Jack</>!//I run the local ranch.//Your lot has plenty of space to raise livestock. Once you’re settled, maybe we can discuss raising animals.
58_Text=Just me and a couple of friends. We’ll be sharing our weeks, and all that jazz.//<portrait=normal>Always welcome to stop by, <PlayerName>$player</>. We’ll be all ears… Consider this an open invitation.
216_Text=Let’s talk another time. I need to get home.
197_Text=Like humans, animals don’t like getting wet.//You should keep them inside on days like this.
34_Text=Looking after my mental health, and all that jazz. You know?
110_Text=Make sure to let your animals out of the barn once in a while, okay?
65_Text=Make sure to talk to your animals every day.//They may not speak the same language we do, but they understand.
208_Text=Make sure your animals are inside, <PlayerName>$player</>!
178_Text=Me, farming? No… Not for me.//Besides, who’s going to take care of my ranch if I farm?//<portrait=surprised>Hmm… Solid point, I do have <NPCName>Kenny</>.
17_Text=My body is very stiff… What am I doing wrong?//I’ve been doing yoga for so long now.
47_Text=My wife is the expert if you need any information about cavern monsters.
165_Text=Never mind.
26_Text=No, I’ve never actually tried it myself.
74_Text=Oh yeah! That’s a good idea, actually.//<portrait=normal>You do need to brush them every day. Good tip.
180_Text=Oh! That’s what I was supposed to do yesterday. I completely forgot to get groceries.
106_Text=Oh, that’s more than enough for me. I can’t eat too much in the morning, or I would… Umm…
91_Text=Oh, that’s more than enough for me. I can’t overeat in the morning, or I would… Umm…
18_Text=Oh, you do yoga too?//So tell me, <PlayerName>$player</>, what did I do wrong?
149_Text=One way is to make sure you talk to your animals every day.//Petting them is a great way to show love as well.
71_Text=Only the best grass for my fodder. Those animals are my friends.//Only the best for them!
70_Text=Or is it an old, charming room? Either way, you get the gist.//<portrait=normal>The room is charming, and it’s old.
10_Text=Over there… There’s a perfectly good creek down there.
164_Text=Part of running the ranch is selling items and keeping up with stock numbers.//<NPCName>Kenny</> would rather be out with the animals, so I handle the store part.
171_Text=People have offered to help me count the supplies on the ranch, but I always turn them down.//It feels good to do it myself.
189_Text=People need to be careful when they let their kids swim in the ocean. I’ve heard some wild legends about what lives down there.//I won’t risk it.
86_Text=Psst… There’s a pile of coconuts just behind the barn.
48_Text=She spent a lot of her adult years under there… Deep in the cavern.
155_Text=She used to camp out in caverns, back in the day.//<portrait=surprised>To clear out the ghouls and stuff.//<portrait=happy>I don’t know for sure. I’ve never been inside a cavern before.
217_Text=Snow’s thick today, huh?//At least it’s warm in here.
42_Text=So excited that you’re here! My first customer of the day.//Need anything?
125_Text=Sometimes, after work, I just put some music on in the living room and dance with <NpcName>Kira</> instead.
181_Text=Sorry, <PlayerName>$player</>, what did you say?
31_Text=Take the path to the left. There should be a path toward the vineyard that leads to town.
138_Text=The extra room in the ranch is for rent, if you know someone who’s looking. Errr…
85_Text=The more you upgrade the fodder, the better quality your animal products will be.
160_Text=The ranch is closing early today, so make sure you get whatever you need quickly.
63_Text=The ranch is old… Takes a lot to maintain.//It was my dad’s, and his dad’s before that.
213_Text=The storm is fine… As long as there’s no blackout.//<portrait=annoyed>Oh yeah, it’s happened, let me tell you. It’ll happen again.//<portrait=concerned>Yes, it will.
218_Text=The town needs to get someone to shovel all the snow. It’s impossible to get around.
163_Text=The vineyard? Hmm… Not really. I don’t really hang out there.//<portrait=concerned>Don’t really know the <NPCName>Walter</> guy that well either.//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Kira</> knows his wife, though.
224_Text=There’s always something to be done around here.//That’s part of running a business.
56_Text=They do need to be mature first. Calves can’t produce milk.
191_Text=This crisp Fall chill makes working outside easier.
221_Text=This old thing doesn’t look so bad, does it?//<portrait=happy>I’ve been taking good care of this building. Look around!
69_Text=Too bad you’re already settled in that cabin, <PlayerName>$player</>.//I would’ve rented you my charming old room.
126_Text=Uh oh… I said too much.
101_Text=Unless you have a well-stocked fridge, that is.
88_Text=Usually coops come with their own incubators. That way you don’t always have to buy chickens from us.//Save some of your hard-earned money, eh?
45_Text=Walking is an excellent way to keep moving, but remember to push yourself every once in a while.
131_Text=We keep piles of fodder in the back, in case there’s a drop in grass supply.
201_Text=Weather forecasting is such a sham sometimes.//<portrait=concerned>They said the rain would be over by now.
137_Text=Well, it’s actually <NpcName>Kenny</> who does that. Heh!
142_Text=Well, when else will you be able to say that you live in a historic building?
75_Text=We’re not selling the ranch to Pufferfish.//It’s been in my family for many generations, and I hope that won’t ever change.
184_Text=What are your favorite Spring veggies, <PlayerName>$player</>?
168_Text=What did you do before you came to Coral Island, <PlayerName>$player</>?
27_Text=What’s it like, anyway?//Moving to a different island and completely starting a new life?
21_Text=When people buy animals from us, we usually ship them the next morning.//But since you live close by, we’ll walk them over right away.
7_Text=Who are my customers? Ha. That’s tricky.//<portrait=normal>You, I guess. And neighboring ranchers.
195_Text=Winter’s too cold to stay late at the ranch.//I usually go right home for a warm meal.
43_Text=Yoga always puts me in a good mood!
49_Text=Yoga always puts me in a good mood! I did a little bit of it this morning.
89_Text=You can place an egg inside and wait a few days for it to hatch. Yeah, exactly! You get it, the usual.
25_Text=You can place bee houses around the island.//They aren’t just limited to your farm… Um… <NpcName>Ben</> told me this.
170_Text=You gave him cheese, huh? That’s too bad. I hope he wasn’t rude about it.//But yeah, <NPCName>Kenny</> doesn’t eat cheese, eggs… Things like that.
140_Text=You get what you pay for around here, I guess.//The barn isn’t brand new anymore. So I can let the extra room go for dirt cheap.
148_Text=You should never be rude to your animals.//They may not understand our language, but they can feel love.
73_Text=You’re really going to tell me how to raise my cattle?//<portrait=happy>I’ve been doing this for who knows how long. And I am a rancher. But go off, I guess.
120_Text=*He’s doing his weekend stretches. Better leave him alone.*
110_Text=Ah yes. <PlayerName>$player</>.
52_Text=And at my age, <PlayerName>$player</>, there’s very little I can do about it.
111_Text=Are you supposed to be back here?
89_Text=At this time of year, we start keeping the heater on at night.
37_Text=Attention can be dangerous. Look at Pufferfish Corporation.//I kept telling everybody, but nobody listened…//<portrait=concerned>We draw way too much notice with festivals and tourism. And now they want to drill here.
71_Text=Back in the day, we had to jot down festivals and birthdays on the calendar ourselves. But now, you can just buy calendars preprinted from <NpcName>Dinda</> or get them from TV shopping.
94_Text=Because we’re different, <PlayerName>$player</>.
70_Text=But a better fishing pole wouldn’t hurt if you’re trying to catch those feisty ones.
119_Text=But that seems like too much to ask nowadays.
29_Text=Even though I don’t fish for living anymore, I still like to read about fish. Found anything interesting lately?
33_Text=Even though I don’t fish for living anymore, I still like to read about fish.//Found anything interesting lately?
39_Text=Fishing can be a way to spend quality time with friends and family. It can also improve your concentration.
6_Text=Fishing is a great skill to cultivate. It builds character and takes patience.
83_Text=Have you caught much salmon lately?
17_Text=How is your fishing skill <PlayerName>$player</>?
13_Text=How’s your fishing skill, <PlayerName>$player</>?
129_Text=I can’t help you much here. You’ll have to come see me at the Beach Shack if you need bait.
22_Text=I do tai chi on my day off and spend the rest of the day scavenging around.
92_Text=I don’t know how you youngsters do it, walking around in the snow and the cold.
2_Text=I don’t know why <NPCName>Connor</> lets anyone move in. Our community is great just as it is.
55_Text=I fish after work when I don’t feel too tired. I suppose that’s the problem with being an old man. Even fun seems like hard work.
99_Text=I guess I’m glad I’ll be spending my day next to a stove.
23_Text=I just try to live a quiet life, <PlayerName>$player</>.//I don’t want attention.
21_Text=I like cooking, especially if the ingredients are fresh from nature and not store-bought.
73_Text=I like to think that I’ve caught almost all the kinds of fish that live around here… There are more than fifty different ones, you know.
67_Text=I remain conflicted about not fixing up the shack. I know <NpcName>Sunny</> doesn’t want to do it. But we both know that the shack will need it one day.
87_Text=I should collect more wood for smoking fish.
85_Text=I still fish here and there, you know, especially now in salmon season.
24_Text=I think a lot of people who live here are the same way.
121_Text=I think this might be the best place to forage for mushrooms.//But I don’t know about the forest since I haven’t been there for a while.
3_Text=I used to fish for a living, but I passed the torch to my son, <NpcName>Theo</>.
118_Text=I want to have a relaxing day without bothering anybody … And vice versa.
69_Text=I wouldn’t be too worried about being bad at fishing. It’s one of those things that improve with practice.
126_Text=If it isn’t your knees, it’s your hips. That’s old age for ya, <PlayerName>$player</>.
123_Text=If you go to the beach, could you tell <NpcName>Theo</> not to sell his whole catch and bring some fish home?
112_Text=If you want to talk, <NpcName>Sunny</> seems to be in the mood to chat.
54_Text=In his defense, it’s where all his memories with...never mind.
68_Text=In his defense, it’s where all his memories with…never mind. We shouldn’t gossip.
82_Text=Its <NpcName>Sam</>’s birthday tomorrow. I think I’ll stop by in the morning to give him some of his favorite blueberry tarts.
86_Text=It’ll be another year before we can enjoy the Summer breeze… The Fall breeze isn’t the same.
7_Text=It’s exciting when you get a bite.//<portrait=normal>And some kinds of bait and certain lures will help you fish better.
38_Text=It’s not wise to show off too much beauty. It’s sad, it’s unfair… But so is life.
127_Text=I’m inclined to say that you’re lost, but I’m not sure.
51_Text=I’m never not tired. That’s not even a question anymore, just a matter of fact… No matter how much rest I get.
42_Text=Like what? Hmm… Trash, for instance. You can easily catch trash.
122_Text=Maybe the forest is a better place to gather mushrooms. I don’t know.
113_Text=Me? No. I’m not.
125_Text=My knees hurt. I think I may have walked too fast.
9_Text=Nature is very giving. There’s plenty of food in the forest and around the lake.
108_Text=Not all fish like the Winter water. Too cold for them…//So there’s only a certain kind of fish that you can catch now.
76_Text=Now that Spring is finally here, I can start gathering some shiitake again.
98_Text=Oh, is it raining?//No wonder it’s colder than usual.
105_Text=Oh, is it snowing?//You have white stuff on your clothes.
80_Text=Oh, that’s true. Calendars nowadays already have festivals and birthdays on them.
40_Text=Powerful stuff.
128_Text=Since you’re here, please excuse me while I get on with it.
8_Text=Sometimes, you can waste a lot of time without getting much in return, though…//You have to be patient.
101_Text=Still stormy outside?!
661B360A4965F6FF483C12896B7E3C0E=Thanks.
79_Text=The Cherry Blossom Festival is on the tenth. Jot it down on your calendar.
34_Text=The library has all kinds of informative books about fish, crops, and other stuff if you’re interested.
97_Text=The rain brings out different kinds of fish.//You can catch some giant mudskippers easier in this weather as well.
81_Text=The water is warm this time of year.
62_Text=There are all kinds of different fish. Some of them are only out at night, so you need to keep the timing in mind if you’re looking for specific ones.
74_Text=There’s no prize for it, I suppose. But it’s nice to know I’ve done it.
72_Text=Things are too easy for this generation. Everything seems to be online now. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? I don’t know.
19_Text=Watch out for poisonous plants, though. Plenty of those, too.
103_Text=Watch your head. It’s quite the storm!
90_Text=Watch your step, please. Slippery floor.
78_Text=Watch your step. I don’t want anybody to slip in my kitchen.
115_Text=What do you need here, kid?
88_Text=Yes, you do need wood to smoke fish.
114_Text=You can buy premade meals from <NpcName>Sam</> or <NpcName>Frank</> at the tavern.//<portrait=normal>He’s quite a cook and sells a lot of different home-cooked meals you can choose from… If you like stuff like that.
41_Text=You can catch more than fish in the sea.
59_Text=You can only make smoked salmon using salmon. I thought that was obvious, you know, given the name.
109_Text=You own the farm. Errr… I want to say that you are…errr…<PlayerName>$player</>?
93_Text=You’ll eventually find out who everyone really is if you give it some time. Some of them you’ll get along with and some you won’t, and that’s okay.
1_Text=You’re…the new farmer?//Tch. I see. No offense, but you look like you’ve never held a tool in your life.
1_Text=An adventurer, hmm?//One of us?
8_Text=Anything that can go wrong, might go wrong.//Prepare for the worst, always.
7_Text=Don't go stepping anywhere unprepared.//That the dumbest thing anyone can do.
2_Text=Looking for weapons?//I might have some.
4_Text=Need some armours?//Okay, suit yourself.
6_Text=Size means nothing.//If you're intimidated by it, maybe combat isn't for you.
5_Text=The key to getting better at combat is training.//That's how all of my students have done it.
3_Text=We don't "hang out." We're here to keep watch of <Italic>that</> cavern and whatever curse that might be inside it.
190_Text=<NPCName>Archie</> gets <NPCName>Dinda</>'s empathetic personality, that's for sure.//He would make a great vet.//Umm...nope.//<portrait=happy>He WILL make a great vet.
138_Text=<NPCName>Bree</> and <NPCName>Walter</> are the other farmers in town.//They run the vineyard.
118_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> and I actually knew each other in grade school! Can you believe it?
136_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> and I have been on Coral Island for…wow, has it been ten years already?//Gosh, must've been more!
106_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> and I used to live in Indonesia. We fell in love with the quiet, peaceful life on the island!
194_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> surprised me with a beautiful bouquet of wooden flowers the other day.//<portrait=normal>She made them herself!
142_Text=<NPCName>Rafael Sanchez</> doesn’t talk much, but he doesn’t have to.//<portrait=normal>His craftsmanship speaks for him.
229_Text=<NPCName>Surya</> loves working with <NPCName>Ling</> down at the lab.
172_Text=<NPCName>Surya</> said there are whales not too far from here! I’d love to see them one day.
187_Text=<NPCName>Theo</> is one of the most positive people I know. I’m not sure how he does it, given…
46_Text=<NpcName>Archie</> is fine, though sometimes he would have a picky-eating period. But what kid doesn’t, right?
22_Text=<NpcName>Dinda</> loves gardening, flower bouquet, salad, and pearls. I honestly don’t think she hates anything.
75_Text=<NpcName>Surya</> is my brother, <NpcName>Suparmo</>'s, oldest son.
31_Text=A new day is here, and the birds are singing. What more can we ask for.
12_Text=After school, I try to take <NpcName>Archie</> to the creek in the forest. I want to teach him things that I learned from my childhood.
104_Text=Ah, I’m going to miss the snow.
201_Text=And when the leaves fall off, you can really see how much yield a tree will give. It’s gorgeous!
84_Text=Are you planting melons this year? It's a popular fruit in our household.
79_Text=As a farmer, you must spend a lot of your time outdoor too, I figure.//Well, at least for us, fresh air isn’t a problem. Heh heh
131_Text=But like I said, can’t really talk today…
198_Text=But look who I’m talking to! I don’t need to tell you that, do I?
135_Text=But people seem to love the work I do. I feel so blessed!
127_Text=Can’t stop to talk today. Just got a huge order!
165_Text=Did you know there are over seventeen species of trees growing on Coral Island?//<portrait=happy>Well, now you do!
51_Text=Do you get your woods from the forest? I go there too because it’s the closest area to the house.//There are plenty of areas that have woods around the island, though, if you need more.
96_Text=Do you have a lot of pumpkins on your farm, <PlayerName>$player</>?
161_Text=Do you know <NPCName>Bree</> from the vineyard yet? I heard she used to be a model.
153_Text=Don’t let her prickly demeanor fool you, though. She’s a good person at heart.
145_Text=Ever tried a yoga class with <NPCName>Leah</>? I love it! She’s a wonderful instructor.
10_Text=Fun finds a way, huh?
223_Text=Hardwood is great to work with. I find a ton down in the deep forest.
199_Text=Have you checked out the Fall colors yet?
166_Text=Have you met <NPCName>Zarah</> yet? She’s very mysterious, always coming and going!
141_Text=Have you met my nephew yet? <NPCName>Surya</>? He’s a lovely fellow!//You should stop by the lab and say hello.
99_Text=Have you tried to make some crafts like scarecrows? They can be very helpful in your farm.
150_Text=He was hesitant at first, but I wouldn’t take no for an answer! He’s family.
76_Text=He's a smart one, you can just tell.
122_Text=Hey there, <PlayerName>$player</>! Working hard or hardly working?
171_Text=He’s actually very convincing. The only problem is I keep finding nuts hidden around the house.//<portrait=normal>He sure loves animal...that one.
151_Text=He’s also a great addition to family board game night. So, win-win!
207_Text=Hot enough for ya? 'Cos it sure is for me.
18_Text=How are you doing today, <PlayerName>$player</>? Is the farm going okay?
16_Text=How is the farm so far, <PlayerName>$player</>? You know, you can build up a greenhouse on your farm to plant more crops. It’s not easy, but it would be worth it. Because you can grow anything all year round in it.
35_Text=How is the farm so far, <PlayerName>$player</>? You know, you can build up a greenhouse on your farm to plant more crops.//It’s not easy, but it would be worth it. Because you can grow anything all year round in it.
182_Text=How’s the soil today, <PlayerName>$player</>? Nutrient rich, I hope!
191_Text=I almost sawed through my wallet in my workshop earlier today!//That’s never happened before.
124_Text=I always keep my tools handy. You’d be surprised how often you need a screwdriver.
25_Text=I can still feel a pinch a bit when I stretch a particular position. But don’t worry though I’m fine. Thanks.
108_Text=I can’t imagine a better life than working with my wife, <NPCName>Dinda</>.//<portrait=happy>She’s like my varnish – I’m just not complete without her.//<portrait=happy>Look at me all <Italic>love-dovey</>! Heh heh!
235_Text=I don’t have any project to do today, so I think I will stay indoors and avoid the storm.
195_Text=I don’t know how she found the time to make them without me knowing.//She’s so sweet! And sneaky!
241_Text=I don’t mind the snow if I already have a project to do.
237_Text=I don’t mind working in the rain if I already have a project to do.
102_Text=I don’t mind working on a project in the Winter. Keeping busy warms me up.
215_Text=I don’t think I will go back to work today. I will just relax and see my friends.
175_Text=I enjoy those too, but sometimes I miss the old days.
87_Text=I feel incredibly old now that I start bragging about waking up early. Heh heh.
52_Text=I get too busy during the week. I can only make it down to yoga classes on Saturdays.
21_Text=I have no doubt that if she opened a restaurant, she would have many loyal customers.//<portrait=happy>And one of them would be me. Heh heh.
245_Text=I hope we get some rain soon.
92_Text=I know it’s irrational, but I can’t help it sometimes.
221_Text=I like teaching <NPCName>Archie</> fishing.//It's a good skill to have.
9_Text=I like to stretch my legs after work and usually end up at Fishensips.
38_Text=I like working outdoor when it isn't raining.
246_Text=I love curling up with a good book on a rainy day. Don’t you?
117_Text=I love stepping into the workshop in the morning. It’s my happy place.
243_Text=I love the rain. But not as much as you, I bet!
154_Text=I love the smell of sawdust in the morning!
200_Text=I love this time of year. The air is crisp; the leaves put on a beautiful show…
203_Text=I love watching the snow fall!//<portrait=concerned>From inside, of course…
110_Text=I love watching them play together.
115_Text=I made a little table for <NPCName>Archie</> when he was a toddler.//He loved it!
49_Text=I make it a habit to come down to the town on the weekend for some yoga.
93_Text=I make sure to buy a few extra pumpkins for <NpcName>Archie</> and me to carve.//<portrait=happy>Now that the weather is nice, we just chill around the house and carve.
85_Text=I might go down to Sam's and see if he's got any melons to sell.//You know, to score that extra brownie points with <NpcName>Dinda</>.
210_Text=I might go to the forest tomorrow and get some more woods.
177_Text=I might make her a custom chessboard as a thank-you. Don’t tell her, though. I want it to be a surprise!
228_Text=I must have watched it for fifteen minutes.
169_Text=I really need to find the time someday.
224_Text=I really should reorganize my workshop. But I’m always just so busy…
183_Text=I saw <NPCName>Jack</> in yoga class last week!//He’s surprisingly flexible.
192_Text=I saw <NPCName>Jim</> doing some kind of martial arts thing at the beach the other day.//Karate, maybe. It was interesting!
29_Text=I saw a grown man throw a bucket full of ice onto himself, outside, in the Winter weather. Why?
163_Text=I saw a wonderfully crafted bannister at the vineyard the other day.//A rich mahogany, exquisite inlays, beautiful curves.
107_Text=I still try to make it home every now and again to visit family.
81_Text=I think the Fall weather is coming.
220_Text=I think this place should have a trivia night. Don’t you?
94_Text=I think this pumpkin carving thing will be a tradition in our family.//I can see it being passed down to generations.
212_Text=I thought I'll stretch a bit here.
119_Text=I took <NPCName>Archie</> up to the old lighthouse last weekend.//<portrait=happy>He spent all his time mermaid-watching.//<portrait=annoyed>He didn’t see any.
173_Text=I used to make fanciful, artisan pieces.//<portrait=happy>Bookshelves with intricate scrollwork on them or hand-made jigsaw puzzles.
193_Text=I was going to ask him about it, but it looked like he wanted to be left alone.
67_Text=I'm not trying to be difficult, but I can’t start working on a large project without payment.
19_Text=I'm teaching <NpcName>Archie</> how to fish. That boy is talented, but there is definitely room for improvement.
78_Text=I've spent a lot of time working outdoors this Summer.
152_Text=If <NPCName>Kira</> looks intimidating, it’s because she is.
114_Text=If I were you, I’d hope she doesn’t expand.//<portrait=happy>She’d put you out of business!
120_Text=If there’s one rule of woodworking, it’s this: Respect the saw.
45_Text=If you want to upgrade your cabin or build something, you would need to supply the materials.
32_Text=Indeed. I did wake up in a very good mood. What gives?
58_Text=It always makes me feel good after a whole day of hard work. It's great to feel productive!
64_Text=It feels good to work with your hands, doesn’t it? You're a farmer, <PlayerName>$player</>, you get it.
83_Text=It was much colder last year.
7_Text=It would be nice to have a large farm like yours, but then taking care of it must take a lot of time.
82_Text=It's incredibly hot this year, I tell ya.
54_Text=It’s best to do it outside and do the easy woodwork indoor.
128_Text=It’s from an independent video rental store on the mainland.//I know, how quaint! I think they still have movies on VHS.
238_Text=It’s nice to rain like this sometimes. It cleans the neighborhood's drainage system.
40_Text=It’s not like they have yoga class any other day, anyway.
53_Text=It’s probably not the healthiest to cut wood indoors, especially with the debris and all flying around.
219_Text=It’s probably not the worst idea to carry around a sword or something when you go to the cavern.
222_Text=It’s so quiet here. So peaceful...one of my favorite place for sure.
178_Text=I’d love to teach <NPCName>Archie</> more about woodworking.//But he seems to want to be a vet when he grows up, which is fine by me.//He should follow his heart.
156_Text=I’ll tell you the same thing I tell my son, <NPCName>Archie</>: Measure twice, cut once.
88_Text=I’m a bit busier than usual.
164_Text=I’m a man who appreciates a fine bannister.
143_Text=I’m a woodworker, but people tend to think of me as a general handyman, too.
179_Text=I’m feeling a little under the weather today…
176_Text=I’m getting into chess! I started playing with <NPCName>Yuri</> at the Shack, and it’s really grown on me.
77_Text=I’m going to focus on work today and have a quiet evening with a plate of banana fritters.
100_Text=I’m not going to focus much on work today. It’s cold, and I can use some downtime.
5_Text=I’m not one to garden, but it would be nice to rely less on <NpcName>Sam</> for fresh fruits.
91_Text=I’m relieved that the Harvest Festival ended without incident.//I’m always worried that a booth might break or something.
218_Text=I’m sure that <NpcName>Rafael</> and <NpcName>Pablo</> are the only blacksmiths around here. They are the only ones who have the equipment to upgrade tools.
97_Text=I’m sure your farm looks excellent! I have to go there and see it sometimes.
186_Text=I’m thinking about taking up calligraphy. You know, with all my spare time…
181_Text=I’m thinking of hiring <NPCName>Macy</> to take a family portrait.//<portrait=normal>She’s an excellent photographer!
55_Text=I’m thinking of taking <NpcName>Archie</> to the forest tomorrow after school.
147_Text=I’ve been learning so much about marine life ever since my nephew, <NPCName>Surya</>, moved in with us.
204_Text=I’ve been racking my brain, trying to think of what to get <NPCName>Dinda</> for her birthday.
134_Text=I’ve been woodworking ever since I was young.//I just did it for fun, but I never thought I could turn my hobby into a career.
112_Text=I’ve gotten really good at making chairs over the years.
168_Text=I’ve never been diving in the ocean before, but my nephew, <NPCName>Surya</>, goes all the time. He tells me it’s beautiful down there.
217_Text=Joining me to fish here, <PlayerName>$player</>?
197_Text=Let me tell ya, there’s nothing like fresh produce.
50_Text=Let’s face it, it's an excellent excuse to see the islanders too.
157_Text=Like it? I made it up myself!
148_Text=Like, did you know octopuses have three hearts? Fascinating stuff!
57_Text=Looking fresh there, <PlayerName>$player</>! You look like you got in some serious farming today.
41_Text=My brother and I used to go fishing every day on Summer break. We would disappear the whole day until the sun sets.
1_Text=My day is great, thank you for asking, <PlayerName>$player</>. How are you today?//<portrait=happy>Have you checked out my furniture store?
159_Text=My favorite day of the year is Beach Cleanup Day. Coral Island is beautiful, but it takes work to keep it that way!
14_Text=My nephew, <NpcName>Surya</>, is new in town. He studied the ocean and is currently working for <NPCName>Ling</>.
109_Text=My son, <NPCName>Archie</>, and <NPCName>Valentina</> get along really well!//<NPCName>Valentina</> is <NPCName>Rafael</>'s niece, you know, and we see them all the time.
170_Text=My son, <NPCName>Archie</>, has been pretending to be a squirrel for the past few weeks.
189_Text=My son, <NPCName>Archie</>, is a huge animal lover. He’s always watching the animal channel on TV, learning all sorts of interesting facts.
20_Text=My wife is a great cook. If she weren’t a carpenter, she would probably be a chef… A big name one, I’m sure.
113_Text=My wife, <NPCName>Dinda</>, keeps a garden. It’s small, but the herbs she grows are delicious.
59_Text=My work needs me to have a lot of energy every day. So every morning, I make sure to have a big breakfast to start the day with.
66_Text=My work needs me to have a lot of energy every day.//So every morning, I make sure to have a big breakfast to start the day with.
236_Text=Need anything, <PlayerName>$player</>?
130_Text=No problem for me, of course! I run a custom shop, you know, and I can make shelving to any specifications. It’s my passion.
2_Text=No time like the present, I always say. Heh heh!
185_Text=No, I don't know when <NPCName>Kenny</>'s birthday is. Sorry!
174_Text=Now I mostly make utilitarian pieces. Desks, tables, chairs. No frills, just practical.
8_Text=Now that I think about it, I don’t think I have the time for it.
23_Text=Oh! She hates avocado, ice cream, and mayonnaise.//Weird texture... To be frank, I’m no fan of mayonnaise, either. It’s rather nasty.
205_Text=Oh, it’s not for months yet. But I’m terrible at coming up with gift ideas. This year, I want to be prepared!
98_Text=One of these days, I will need to check on the community center and the lab to prepare them for Winter.//You know, just a quick inspection to make sure that the heater is working, no leaks on the roofs, and whatnot.
242_Text=Our herb plants wilted. None of them can survive the Winter snow.
111_Text=People are so interesting, aren’t they? Everyone has a story!
36_Text=Remember to take a rest, <PlayerName>$player</>. Wealth isn’t everything.
121_Text=See how I still have all my fingers? That’s because I take the rule seriously.
162_Text=She still is, of course.//<portrait=happy>A model citizen, that is!
216_Text=Sorry if I seem dusty. It’s not easy to get rid of sawdust.
27_Text=Sunday is our short day. We are only open until 1ish.
34_Text=That it’s a powerful thing!
144_Text=That’s okay. I love to help out!
206_Text=The Harvest Festival is just around the corner!
80_Text=The evenings have started to cool off a bit.
213_Text=The house is not bad, eh? <NpcName>Dinda</> and I built it ourselves. Took us a long time, but it’s really sturdy!//We never thought we needed to expand because we were too caught up in work.
56_Text=The lake is too far from our house. I think by the time we fish there and back, it would be close to midnight.
33_Text=The library is a place full of information. And you know what they say about knowledge!
90_Text=The mayor will have one empty booth for you to use if you decide to join in, <PlayerName>$player</>. I will make sure it’s nice and sturdy.
105_Text=The snow may be melting soon, but the weather will still be chilly for at least the first week.
17_Text=The soil here is very rich. When I take <NpcName>Archie</> to the forest, we always seem to stumble upon a new plant type.
69_Text=The thing with <NpcName>Archie</> is that if one of his friends is sick, the whole class would probably be sick. Then, do you know who gets sick after that?
74_Text=The warmer weather is ahead. Are you planting any berries this Summer?
227_Text=The way it caught yesterday’s sawdust floating through the air was just… It was just magical.
70_Text=Their parents, which includes me.
28_Text=There are fascinating people on TV. I’m lost for words sometimes.
208_Text=There are simple crafts that you can make yourself to improve your farm, like scarecrows or lamp posts.
72_Text=There are simple crafts that you can make yourself to improve your farm.
71_Text=There is so much that we can pass on to our children. The little thing that we, the parents, do can become their habit.
202_Text=There’s nothing better than sitting with a cup of hot cocoa while looking at the snow.
244_Text=There’s nothing like the sound of rain pitter-pattering over the workshop. I could listen to it all day!
129_Text=They want new shelving for their store, but the dimensions are odd.//A few centimeters under industry-standard, rounded corners…
24_Text=This job comes with the territory. I threw my back out one time and had to be on bed rest for the rest of the year.
137_Text=Time flies when you’re having fun!
95_Text=To be frank, I don’t care much about how our pumpkins look when I carve with <NpcName>Archie</>.//<portrait=happy>I just know that it’s something that he's always looking forward to every year, and it's become a tradition.
65_Text=We are lucky, <PlayerName>$player</>. Not everyone can do what we do.//Don’t be too hard on yourself, okay.
211_Text=We are making some new furniture.
234_Text=We are not accepting projects right now, but if you need an upgrade or buy anything, stop by tomorrow.
26_Text=We are open 'til 5pm today.
44_Text=We don’t sell our woods. We just don’t have the space to store that kind of inventory.
196_Text=We just harvested some fresh herbs from <NPCName>Dinda</>'s garden!
6_Text=We plant small vegetables and herbs, but our garden is not big enough to grow fruits.
73_Text=We sell some of these blueprints if you would like to try it.
116_Text=We use it for storage now, but looking at it still brings back happy memories.
214_Text=We used to live in the shed...it's now the little workshop right behind the shop counter, until we wanted to expand our family.//Then, we reconstructed the shed to build the extra bedrooms.
188_Text=Well, it doesn’t matter. He’s a remarkable person.
68_Text=Well, large projects are more like upgrading a house or building a coop. I don’t consider a shipping bin or a chair, a large project.
247_Text=What a perfect day to curl up with a good book!
86_Text=What is it about Summer that is making people productive?//I woke up earlier than usual and got way more things done during the day.
184_Text=What you heard is true.<NPCName>Kira</> doesn't celebrate birthdays.//I think <NPCName>Kenny</> does though.
226_Text=When I walked into the workshop this morning, there was this amazing sunbeam streaming through the window.
149_Text=When my nephew, <NPCName>Surya</>, moved to town, I invited him to come live with us right away.
180_Text=Whenever I start feeling sick, <NPCName>Dinda</> makes me tea with fresh peppermint from her garden.//It peps me right up!
13_Text=Where I am from, there are plenty of small islands too. Just like in here.
89_Text=With the Harvest Festival coming up, I have to make sure all the booths are ready to use and fix the broken parts.
158_Text=Work is really picking up! I wonder if I’ll need to expand…
123_Text=Working hard, I bet. Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.
230_Text=Wow! You're out and about!//I think I will stay indoors today because you know...the rain.
61_Text=You can buy the wall clocks if you'd like. They're for sale.//Talk to <NpcName>Dinda</> for more information though, she deals with the sales.
225_Text=You can hear the wind whistling through the trees from here.
30_Text=You can make a bouquet of flowers yourself. You just need to get the recipe from <NpcName>Dinda</> or <NpcName>Ben</>. The key is to get to know them a little, and they will probably teach you.
60_Text=You can see our available projects at the cash register. We keep the catalog there.
125_Text=You must have quite the green thumb, <PlayerName>$player</>!
139_Text=You should go introduce yourself if you haven’t already.
146_Text=You should join us in class sometime, <PlayerName>$player</>! You’d love it.
126_Text=You should probably stop by the clinic to get that checked out.//<portrait=happy>Ha ha! I crack me up.<lf>
37_Text=You're always welcome to our house for dinner. I know it’s hard to be away from family sometimes.
15_Text=You've met him, right? He is about your age, I believe.
140_Text=You’re a busy little bee, aren’t you? Well, don’t let me get in your way!
160_Text=You’re coming this year, right?
155_Text=You’re not really in a talking mood today, are you, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I can tell. I have a sixth sense about these things.
167_Text=Y’know, it’s not just wood that I work with. I also carve a mean jack-o’-lantern.
5_Text=Are you here to help us, <PlayerName>$player</>?
4_Text=At Pufferfish, it's all about work-life balance. We make sure we have some weekends off so our workers can do things.
6_Text=I think you can really make a difference in the world. We can help you achieve that goal here.
2_Text=Liking our office?//<portrait=normal>We, at Pufferfish, are working hard down here all day and all night. It's important to us to make the office as comfortable as possible.
3_Text=The window in my office gives full visibility to the workers.
7_Text=We can't really see the outdoor from the office.//It's by design. We don't need those distraction when we need to focus.
9_Text=We keep the temperature the same all year long inside the office.//There is something about being cold and how it increases productivity.
10_Text=We stock only coffee and water for our workers. Any other drinks are not important.
1_Text=Would you look at who's here if not the farmer.//What can I do for you?
8_Text=You boots are full of snow.
348_Text=*appears to be sleeping*
215_Text=*mourning*
326_Text=*shivering* Someone light a fire! I’m freezing in here!
277_Text=*staring into space*//<portrait=concerned>What time is it?
168_Text=*zones out*
210_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> has been trying to find the right formula to improve our fodder… That’s no rumor!
216_Text=<NPCName>Luke</> was selling a self-stirring pot one time, but the product was pulled by the manufacturer before anyone had the chance to buy it.
204_Text=<NPCName>Millie</> once said to me that evening snow made her feel like she was living inside a snow globe.//<portrait=daydreaming>She felt liberated yet fragile at the same time.
235_Text=<NPCName>Theo</> and I were in the middle of the ocean when it started storming.//<portrait=normal>It was fine, though. We made it to land okay.
22_Text=<NpcName>Pablo</> and <NpcName>Rafael</> are good friends of mine.//They’re very talented blacksmiths, living right across from the taco truck.//<portrait=smile>You could say they’re my go-to experts.
166_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I’m sorry. I just got a little lost in the color of the trees.
257_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, have you fed your animals yet today? They could get sick if you forget to feed them.
289_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, whoa! Be careful!//<portrait=concerned>You almost stepped on that ant.
224_Text=A bit too stuffy in here at the moment.//<portrait=concerned>I think the humidity is getting to us.
76_Text=A pleasant surprise, that is. A very pleasant surprise.//As if the universe wants us to spend the day together. Do you believe in <Italic>things</> like that?
52_Text=Ah, I might go to Fishensips this weekend.//<portrait=normal>I don’t know…//Will you be there?
51_Text=And don’t forget to feed them, of course!//<portrait=normal>I hope that one is obvious.
33_Text=And maybe a handful of soybeans.
287_Text=Animals are great listeners.//Even though they can’t talk to me, I always get the sense that they’re listening.
194_Text=Animals get cold too, especially when it’s snowing like this. Make sure to turn your heater on, okay?
282_Text=Animals that are taken care of well give the best milk, wool, and eggs.//The money from the sale of that stuff helps the businesses around here.
4_Text=Animals, they’re not much different from us.//<portrait=smile>My dad taught me that.
102_Text=Another year has begun. These cherry blossom petals are a beautiful reminder.
105_Text=Are you close to <NPCName>Macy</>?//<portrait=normal>I believe it’s her birthday tomorrow.
263_Text=Are you doing anything fun this weekend, <PlayerName>$player</>?
232_Text=Are you familiar with <NPCName>Peanut</> and <NPCName>Butter</>?//They’re <NPCName>Frank</> and <NPCName>Erika’s</> cats.//<portrait=laugh>Brilliant little fellas. They know which furniture is theirs.
177_Text=Are you going to the Winter Fair tomorrow?
337_Text=Are you here to get a tool fixed too?//It’s so nice to chat with <NPCName>Pablo</> and <NPCName>Rafael</> while they work.
275_Text=Are you planning to take home a new animal?//<portrait=normal>I can tell you which ones are the friendliest.
302_Text=As amazing as watching nature is, I’d rather not be soaking wet while I do it.
179_Text=Aww… Well, if you have time, you should stop by. <NpcName>Luke</> and I are going tomorrow.
99_Text=Being a first-time farmer must be challenging. There’s a lot to get used to, huh?
54_Text=But grass doesn’t grow in Winter. //Well, most plants don’t. So…//<portrait=laugh>That’s when the ranch comes in handy.
66_Text=But grass doesn’t grow in Winter.//Well, most plants don’t. So…//<portrait=laugh>That’s when the ranch comes in handy.
117_Text=Can you hear that, <PlayerName>$player</>? All the trees are singing. They’re so happy it’s finally Spring.
311_Text=Come on, <PlayerName>$player</>, let’s get you inside. Storms are even more dangerous at night.//You can’t see if something’s flying through the air at you.
318_Text=Come see me tomorrow so I know you got home safely, okay?
21_Text=Communicate your needs and wants all the way to your soul, <PlayerName>$player</>. And let nature decide your next steps. That’s what I do.

173_Text=Dad enters a cooking competition every year. Mom and I usually go to town to watch and give him emotional support.
221_Text=Dad sautéed a questionable fruit from the forest one time, thinking it was jackfruit.//Hmm…//<portrait=sad>The whole cabin smelled like rotten eggs for a week.
341_Text=Dad wants me to buy something here, but I’m not really sure what I’m looking for.
222_Text=Dad’s a good cook, though.//<portrait=laugh>Just a little too adventurous for his own good sometimes.
308_Text=Did you like my dramatic voice?//<portrait=laugh>Maybe I should take up acting!
285_Text=Do you check the weather forecast, <PlayerName>$player</>?//You really should. Animals need shelter from the rain just like humans do.
280_Text=Do you ever daydream, <PlayerName>$player</>? It’s one of my bad habits.
290_Text=Do you have a favorite kind of animal, <PlayerName>$player</>?

255_Text=Do you play any instruments, <PlayerName>$player</>? I’ve been trying to learn this new song on my flute, but it’s not going so well.
164_Text=Do you think ranch animals notice the changing of the seasons as much as we do?//Do you think they notice the days getting shorter and the air getting colder?
331_Text=Do you want a ranch like this one day?
112_Text=Even if I weren’t here, the natural world would keep on going without me.//<portrait=normal>I know that sounds bad, but it’s a strange comfort to me.
156_Text=Even though my parents don’t celebrate birthdays, they still love getting presents.

163_Text=Fall is the most delicious time of year! Nothing beats harvest time for a good meal…or five.
122_Text=Finally, Spring!//<portrait=daydreaming>I welcome the sound of the creatures coming back to life.
9_Text=For sure, the cows appreciate it when I play the flute.//I like to think it relaxes them.
158_Text=Funbucket is one of our ducks.//But <NPCName>Ben</> comes by often to help out with the animals, and they seem to have bonded. So Funbucket is his now too.
256_Text=Gosh, I should check the weather forecast for tomorrow.//We’ll have to take the animals inside the barn if it rains.
327_Text=Got a blanket on you, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=concerned>No?//<portrait=normal>That’s okay.
200_Text=Ha ha ha. That cracked me up. You’re technically correct. I concur.
109_Text=Has that ever happened at your farm?
193_Text=Have you checked on your animals today?//<portrait=smile>They can use some extra love on days like this.
63_Text=Have you ever looked at the sky and wondered what’s out there?
336_Text=Have you ever looked into an animal’s eyes and wondered what they’re thinking, or what they would say if they could talk?//<portrait=daydreaming>It’s one of my favorite things to think about.
148_Text=Have you harvested any pineapples yet? I hear they’re great grilled!
347_Text=Have you learned to cook anything tasty?
113_Text=Have you planted any Spring flowers, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=laugh>Make sure your animals don’t snack on them!
253_Text=Have you spent time down by the lake, <PlayerName>$player</>?//It’s gorgeous over there.
174_Text=He likes things like that.
247_Text=Hello, hello! None of the cows farted on me this morning, so I’m pretty sure that means it’s going to be a good day.

344_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>!//Mom must have let you in.
258_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>, get this!//<portrait=normal>I was about to eat my lunch yesterday when a deer wandered up next to me. I felt so bad for it that I gave it my edamame.
339_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>. Is it just me, or does everything feel quieter around here?
119_Text=Hey, you wanna join me and listen to the birds? They’re so cheerful right now.
314_Text=Hmm… Look at it go…
269_Text=Hmm… Should I go for a swim later?
219_Text=Hmm… What do you think that painting over there is trying to convey?
165_Text=Hmm… What?
84_Text=Hmm… When my mouth can’t find the words, I rely on my flute to do the talking.
249_Text=Hopefully, <NPCName>Bessie</> won’t step on it again…
191_Text=Hopefully, it won’t happen, but the wind could wreck your roof.
81_Text=How scary is that?
295_Text=I always bring extra food for the ants.
197_Text=I can imagine watching the snow as it falls.
298_Text=I can’t play my flute outside, either.

47_Text=I don’t really go to the beach unless there’s an important event going on.//<portrait=sad>Yeah, no.
190_Text=I don’t want to spread negativity, but you should always check your barn and chicken coop during a storm.//Especially a strong one like this.
332_Text=I feel like I never stop cleaning in here, but I don’t mind.//If it makes the animals happy, then I’m happy.
279_Text=I found a gecko on the barn floor last week. It freaked out the cows a little, but I thought it was really cool!
188_Text=I guess I’ve always known I want to work with animals.//I want to make sure they’re properly cared for.
320_Text=I guess it is kind of funny when it piles up on the cows’ backs.
305_Text=I guess leaving animals out in the rain would make them cleaner, but it also makes them upset.//<portrait=normal>You should always be sure your animals have a dry place to stay when it rains.
162_Text=I guess that’s what Fishensips is good for. Nothing warms you up like a hot tea on a chilly evening!
68_Text=I have no worries when I’m around you. You seem like a loving person.//<portrait=normal>You just have that aura.
75_Text=I have to say…I’m a little surprised to see you here, <PlayerName>$player</>.
322_Text=I have to start prepping for Spring.
94_Text=I hope Pufferfish changes their mind.//<portrait=sad>All I sense from this is negativity.
300_Text=I hope this clears up tomorrow. I really want to eat in the forest again.
325_Text=I hope this snow stops tomorrow.//Maybe I can go digging for root vegetables after work.
91_Text=I just get really sleepy afterward. Not a great feeling at all. Blech!
8_Text=I just knew it.
58_Text=I learned this from my granddad.//So, once you have animals, make sure to talk to them every day. It’s all they need.//<portrait=concerned>And food...you get that, right?
292_Text=I loaned my best tool to <NPCName>Ben</>, but he hasn’t given it back yet. Should I ask him about it?
70_Text=I prefer to have my lunch break outdoors. Be one with nature, yeah? When the weather permits, that is.
231_Text=I prefer to spend my time in nature.//<portrait=daydreaming>Here and the forest are two of my favorite places.
312_Text=I really shouldn’t be out here in weather like this, but I couldn’t help myself.//<portrait=smile>I wanted to see nature’s power firsthand!
230_Text=I remember Mom brought some weird things home from her combat journeys.//<portrait=smile>My treasure chest was full of silver spoons and colorful rocks.
254_Text=I saw the most beautiful fish there the other day.//<portrait=daydreaming>It had this silver head and rainbow scales. I wonder if it’s rare.
306_Text=I sleep so well when it’s raining.//<portrait=daydreaming>The <Italic>tap tap tap</> on my window is strangely comforting.
62_Text=I spend a lot of my free time doing just that. Looking at the sky, letting my mind wander… This world sometimes feels too small for my imagination.

124_Text=I think the daisies in Summer are nature telling us it’s happy and healthy. Don’t you think?
248_Text=I took one of my tools to <NPCName>Rafael</> to have him repair it. It came back good as new!
107_Text=I try to stay away from animal products as much as I can.
213_Text=I want to visit <NPCName>Stephen</> more often. He fascinates me. But I’m not too fond of the beach… Too far. The energy is all off over there.
259_Text=I was going to give the deer my water, but I don’t think it could drink out of a bottle.
154_Text=I was shocked to wake up this morning and realize it’s already the 16th. *sighs*
92_Text=I went to town yesterday and saw a drilling corporation is moving its offices to Coral Island.//<portrait=concerned>I’m disappointed, to be honest.
135_Text=I wish I could hibernate like the bears. Sleep through the cold Winter and wake up when it’s warm again in Spring.
316_Text=I wish I could still see the storm outside.//<portrait=normal>It was so much fun to watch while it was light!
157_Text=If you want to win my mom over, she has a soft spot for flowers.
153_Text=Incredible how time flies, isn’t it?
95_Text=Is Pufferfish building a mini golf area in front of their office?//<portrait=annoyed>Ugh… I kind of want to play.
328_Text=Is it just me, or does snow make Winter nights twice as cold?
242_Text=Is that gross?//I’m sorry. I just think it’s cool that even animal waste has a good use.
152_Text=Is there a flower nearby that I can brush it on?
126_Text=It is hotter than I’d like for eating outside, but it’s much better than eating inside.//<portrait=daydreaming>Nothing beats eating in nature, not even air-conditioned rooms.
145_Text=It stung me, but I think it was just scared.
93_Text=It was a shock, really.//I had no idea they were buying properties here. What will they make of Coral Island, I wonder?
260_Text=It’s Friday! I can’t wait to celebrate at the tavern tonight.//<portrait=normal>Come with me?
116_Text=It’s always good to be organized.
189_Text=It’s getting dark, <PlayerName>$player</>…
286_Text=It’s good to leave your plants out in the rain, though!//<portrait=laugh>Weird how nature works.
350_Text=It’s hard to stay focused when I get stuck.//It makes me want to do something else instead.
268_Text=It’s my day off! What should I do today? There’s so much to explore around here!
330_Text=It’s nice in here, isn’t it?//<portrait=normal>I think my grandparents did a great job building the place.
304_Text=It’s not <Italic>really</> reliable, but hey… We don’t have anything better.//I’ll have to take a look later.
267_Text=It’s okay if you didn’t. I made this amazing vegan taco I’m going to eat later. I can’t wait!
140_Text=It’s so cold that even a hot cup of green tea isn’t helping.//<portrait=sad>I should just head inside.
354_Text=It’s so nice to come here and hang out in the evenings.//<portrait=normal>I think I’m the only person here who doesn’t complain about their job, though!
59_Text=It’s the weekend again!//<portrait=smile>Anything exciting happening?
346_Text=It’s time for a snack! I love the way good smells fill up the whole house.//<portrait=normal>It makes me happy that it’s such a small place.
128_Text=I’m a little sad, friend. The trees are starting to lose their leaves, and the animals are leaving.//<portrait=normal>Well, I guess I still have the animals at the ranch.
196_Text=I’m curious to see how beautiful the view must be from up above.
343_Text=I’m glad I’m not out in the rain today.//I don’t mind the rain itself, but trying to wrangle the animals while I’m all wet isn’t my idea of a good time.
324_Text=I’m glad I’m not out there working in that slush.//<portrait=annoyed>I don’t like it; the animals don’t like it… It’s a bad time all around.
181_Text=I’m glad we have a heater for the animals at the ranch.//<portrait=concerned>I hate to think about them being cold and lonely when I’m not there.
178_Text=I’m most interested in chatting with the merchants, sharing stories. They have an interesting view of the world.
176_Text=I’m no good with names. I can’t remember what they were called.//Shy flowers… They only bloom after sunset.
134_Text=I’m not a big fan of the cold.//It’s hard to eat your lunch outside when you’re constantly shivering.
80_Text=I’m not a fan of processed foods. I read somewhere that they’re engineered to make us addicted to them.
218_Text=I’m not going to buy anything today.//Probably not the wisest choice, carrying around electronics in this weather.
118_Text=I’m playing along with the trees, <PlayerName>$player</>. They’re so happy to be alive.//<portrait=daydreaming>Can you hear them sing?
130_Text=I’m savoring all the time I can spend outside now.//<portrait=sad>In about a week, I won’t be able to enjoy the outdoors like this.
120_Text=I’m so glad I can eat lunch outside again. I missed doing that in Winter.
161_Text=I’m trying to catch as much sun as I can near the lake while it’s still Fall.//Once Winter comes, the sun is too weak to warm you up.
349_Text=I’m trying to figure out this flute melody, but I’m having a hard time.//<portrait=sad>Sometimes the musical notes seem to jump off the page and float away.
111_Text=I’ve always loved that my birthday falls in Spring.//<portrait=daydreaming>It feels like nature is putting on a show for me.
265_Text=Just smell that fresh air!//<portrait=smile>I’m so lucky I get to work outside.
214_Text=Just thought I’d pay the <NPCName>Sanchez</> brothers a visit.//It’s been a while since we all hung out.
310_Text=Keep an eye on your crops and animals!//They might blow away if you’re not careful!
192_Text=Keep warm, <PlayerName>$player</>.
69_Text=Kombucha is the best drink to have with lunch...love it, yeah?//Especially when it’s sunny out. It has that refreshing kick, you know?
86_Special=LastDialogueOfTheDayOnly
201_Special=Less income.
171_Text=Let me tell you a Winter story.//I don’t remember when it was exactly, but it was snowing out.//<portrait=smile>The kids came to me and asked me to play the flute while they sang a birthday song to <NPCName>Randy</>.
307_Text=Let me tell you a tale…of the forest.//One dark, rainy night in the woods, something shivered behind a tree.//<portrait=concerned>It was neither man nor beast.//<portrait=annoyed>It was…a ghost!
147_Text=Let’s go swimming there sometime!
123_Text=Look up, <PlayerName>$player</>! The birds are coming back, slowly but surely.//<portrait=daydreaming>Just listen to their melodious voices…
131_Text=Look up, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=concerned>A lot of birds are migrating south.//Goodbye, sweet birds.//<portrait=daydreaming>I’ll see you again in Spring.
319_Text=Lots of people think snow is beautiful, but it just makes me think of everything that’s buried underneath it.//<portrait=sad>Plants, baby animals, people…
229_Text=Lunch tastes so much better here, doesn’t it?
34_Text=Make sure to keep your animals inside when it rains, will you?
67_Text=Make sure to keep your animals inside when it rains, yeah?
333_Text=Make sure you keep your barn clean.
182_Text=Make sure you stay bundled up, <PlayerName>$player</>. Even though we’re on an island, it can get pretty chilly here.
245_Text=Make sure you take time to smell the roses! And the petunias, and the tulips, and the daisies…
291_Text=Me? I’m not allowed to pick a favorite. I love them all equally.
264_Text=Me? Well, I’m hoping to head to the forest after I finish work.//I’m really trying to get this flute melody down.
45_Text=Mom is a retired hunter, but she’s always on high alert.//<portrait=concerned>She’d go back into combat in a heartbeat, if necessary.
262_Text=Mom made me scrambled eggs for breakfast, but I just can’t stand that kind of thing.//<portrait=concerned>I left it on a plate outside the house. Maybe a deer will snack on it.
97_Text=Mom used to slay monsters for a living, but she doesn’t anymore.//<portrait=normal>She thinks the island is safe for now, so she just keeps an eye on the cavern.//She never let me play around there… Monster infested, she said.
206_Text=My dad taught me how to handle animals at a young age.//I feel like almost all my significant memories are here on this ranch.
10_Text=My friends <NpcName>Pablo</> and <NpcName>Rafael</> are very talented blacksmiths.//<portrait=smile>They’re my go-to experts when the ranch needs any tools fixed.
98_Text=My parents and I have different views on some things, but I’m glad they’re respectful of my opinions.//<portrait=normal>For example, my parents don’t celebrate birthdays, but they don’t force that view on me. I celebrate mine, all right!//Spring 9 baby here!
100_Text=My parents had me when they were relatively young.//Because of that, I feel like we’re speaking the same language most of the time.//There isn’t much of a generation gap.
48_Text=No reason. I guess I just don’t have the drive to go to the beach that much.
179_Special=No, I’m a bit busy.
133_Text=Not gonna lie, Winter bums me out a bit. The trees are quiet, and a lot of animals either are hibernating or have migrated to somewhere warmer.
321_Text=Now, where are those Winter seeds I left lying around?//I hope they didn’t get buried in the snow.
278_Text=Oh no! Is it really that late already?//<portrait=normal>I didn’t mean to zone out for that long! Thanks for snapping me out of it, <PlayerName>$player</>.
293_Text=Oh well. He’ll probably return it when he’s done.
77_Text=Oh yeah, love it. Kombucha is the best drink to have with lunch. Especially when it’s sunny out. It has that refreshing kick, you know?
315_Text=Oh! Sorry about that.//<portrait=normal>I sort of got lost in the swirling wind.//<portrait=laugh>It’s all very dramatic.
303_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>! Have you checked the weather forecast yet? I hope it’s not raining again tomorrow.
297_Text=On the one hand, rain is good for plants and animals that need a safe water source.//<portrait=sad>On the other hand, it means I can’t eat my lunch outside.
3_Text=One thing I can tell you, <PlayerName>$player</>, rancher to rancher.//You need to talk to your animals to connect with them.
175_Text=One time, Mom brought home flowers that were white as snow. Very delicate flowers.
151_Text=Oops! I got a little bit of pollen on my hat.//Good thing it didn’t land in my eyes!
288_Text=Or maybe they’re just waiting to see if I pull a snack out of my pocket.//<portrait=smile>That’s also possible.
270_Text=Or should I play my flute?//So many choices…
17_Text=Or, if you’re anything like me, you can just eat those vegetables raw. Less work!
31_Text=Or, if you’re anything like me, you can just eat those vegetables raw.//<portrait=laugh>Less work!
345_Text=Or…you let yourself in? Which is fine. You’re family.
187_Text=Our animals don’t like the rain very much.//<NPCName>Luke</> said <NpcName>Taco</> hates the rain too.//<portrait=laugh>He gets really lazy and stays inside the house all day when it rains.
252_Text=People call Wednesday “hump day,” but I call it “moo day.”//<portrait=normal>It’s the day we bathe all the cows!
201_Text=Perhaps it’s a helpful reminder for us to rest. An opportunity to do something in life besides work and count our money.
186_Text=Perhaps we can sit somewhere dry and chat.
225_Text=Please help yourself, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>We’re all family here.
355_Text=Ranching is hard work, but I love it.
106_Text=She’s a beautiful soul with a big soft spot for animals.
209_Text=Since I have you here, let me just say something really quick.//You still need to feed your animals, even though they’re out during the day.
125_Text=Since the days are longer in Summer, it’s nice to have all this time to spend outside.
323_Text=Snow is part of nature, but it’s not my favorite part.//<portrait=laugh>I’d rather be stretched out under the Spring sun than slipping on this ice.
220_Text=So many thoughts went into that art piece.//<portrait=daydreaming>When I look at it, I can feel conviction and hope. Deep in my bones.
237_Text=So much to think about.
233_Text=Some of the paintings at Socket & Pan are <NPCName>Dippa’s</>.//They use it as a platform to market their art.
334_Text=Sometimes Bessie’s hard to work with, but other days she’s sweet and gentle.//<portrait=laugh>She’s got such a strong personality.
273_Text=Sometimes I even hear them when I zone out…//<portrait=laugh>Or maybe that’s because there’s a cow standing right behind me.
85_Text=Sometimes there’s no other way to do it. Words aren’t enough.
110_Text=Spring is my favorite time of year!//<portrait=normal>The flowers are opening up, the fawns are learning to walk… It feels like everything is waking up after Winter.
115_Text=Spring is the time to plan for the year to come.//Have you taken stock of all your crops and animals yet?
238_Text=Stephen was stranded and had lost his left claw when <NPCName>Macy</> rescued him…//<portrait=normal>The last time I saw him, he was recovering quite well.
149_Text=Summer heat makes moving the animals around twice as hard. It’s not so bad, though. At least it’s already light when I get up in the morning!
127_Text=Sure, the Summer heat makes my work harder, but I’d rather sweat it out surrounded by nature than stay inside.
23_Text=The boys make durable weapons too.//Mom always puts in a good word for them.
144_Text=The bugs are always thickest in Summer.//Yesterday, I caught a wasp in the barn and released it outside.
146_Text=The color of the lake is so beautiful this time of year.//When you splash, the water makes little rainbows in the sunlight.
27_Text=The cows appreciate it when I play the flute...oh yeah, for sure!//<portrait=smile>I like to think it relaxes them.
24_Text=The cows appreciate it when I play the flute.//<portrait=smile>I like to think it relaxes them.
101_Text=The gap? Oh… I just mean it’s easy to tell my parents how I feel about stuff. Or, you know, just to communicate in general.
141_Text=The hot spring sounds so good right now.
207_Text=The loudest quack is Funbucket’s.//<portrait=smile>She’s our most outspoken duck.
271_Text=The mayor was telling me the other day that you’re quite the rancher!//<portrait=normal>You’ll have to come tell me about your adventures sometime.
86_Text=The more I think about us – humans – the sadder I get.//We put chemicals in our food… Some of us put each other down for no reason at all… Disappointing behavior.
183_Text=The plants and animals are all sleeping, tucked away under the snow. It makes me feel like I should be sleeping, too.
234_Text=The weather channel isn’t always right.//<portrait=annoyed>I got caught in the middle of a snowstorm one time on my way to Turtle Island.
114_Text=There are so many delicious things you can grow in Spring!//<portrait=daydreaming>My mouth is watering with all the taco possibilities…
172_Text=There were definitely tears that day.
142_Text=There’s a picture of me playing on your farm when I was maybe eight years old.//It’s hanging somewhere in our cabin.
301_Text=There’s not much you can do outside when it’s raining, so I like to pass the time in here.
180_Text=Things might not be perfect, but I did my best this year, which is good enough for me.//Here’s to the New Year!
351_Text=This is a great place to forage mushrooms and wild veggies.
159_Text=This is the most beautiful foliage I’ve ever seen on Coral Island!
167_Text=This island looks like a completely different place when it’s covered in snow like this.
335_Text=This might sound a little weird, but I think animals really understand us.
241_Text=This might sound weird, but I don’t mind the smell of manure.//Dad was telling me it makes great fertilizer for the fields!
294_Text=This might sound weird, but being here right now feels as natural as…well…nature.//<portrait=daydreaming>I can’t think of anywhere else I’d rather be.
309_Text=This storm is really nasty, <PlayerName>$player</>!//<portrait=concerned>You shouldn’t be out in it!
223_Text=This time of year, your cabin must be cold too.
143_Text=This was back when it was still your grandparents’.
313_Text=To be safe inside, with a roof over my head during a storm… It makes me feel very grateful.
195_Text=To keep warm during Winter, Mom used to go to the cavern and slay monsters.//<portrait=concerned>I felt kind of bad for her.
199_Special=Unity. That we’re all under the same blanket of existence.
199_Text=Very wise. I must agree. Keep going with whatever project you’re working on. You’re onto something big.
132_Text=Want some of my green tea, <PlayerName>$player</>? I always carry some in Fall. It’s a nice, quick warm-up when it’s chilly.
208_Text=We could use an extra heater here.//<portrait=normal>Can I help you with anything?
108_Text=We had to take care of an injured cow this morning.//<portrait=sad>I think she’s going to make it, but it’ll be close.
281_Text=Well, I guess it’s not really bad. But I probably shouldn’t do it while I’m working, huh?
160_Text=Well, I say that every year, but I really mean it this time!
261_Text=Well, I still have to work tomorrow morning, but I’ll take any excuse to spend time with <NPCName>Frank</> and <NPCName>Pablo</>.

266_Text=What’s that amazing smell? Did you bring me a snack, <PlayerName>$player</>?
136_Text=When it’s cold like this, there’s nothing like a cup of hot green tea to warm you up.
272_Text=When you work with animals like I do, you start to hear moos and baas in your sleep.
217_Text=Whoa! Excuse me for laughing.//I don’t know why that was so funny.
244_Text=Whoops! I almost bumped into you!//<portrait=normal>Where are you off to in such a rush?
121_Text=Why spend time indoors when you can be outdoors enjoying nature? Just look at all these blooming flowers!
96_Text=Wild fruit and mushrooms are gifts of nature.//They’re so easy to find around here.
138_Text=Winter is always so quiet.//Hear that? Basically nothing…just faint music far, FAR away.//Don’t worry, I hear it too. It’s nature’s music.
137_Text=Winter makes me think of roasted almonds.//<portrait=normal>Hmm, maybe I’ll stop by <NPCName>Sam’s</>and buy some to roast over the fire.
296_Text=Working in the rain can be challenging, but I don’t mind.//At least it washes a lot of the junk and pollution out of the air.
299_Text=Wow, it’s been raining since this morning.//<portrait=sad>The animals aren’t going to be happy about being cooped up all day.
20_Text=Wow. You lead such a busy life. Remember to take a break and communicate with nature.
5_Text=Wow. You lead such a busy life.//Remember to take a break and communicate with nature.
283_Text=Yeah, money is nice.//<portrait=concerned>But it shouldn’t be the only reason to be kind to animals.//<portrait=normal>They deserve love, just like we do.
60_Text=Yeah, my week was good.//<portrait=normal>Same old, same old, though.//What about you?//I hope your week was good too.
178_Special=Yes, it sounds exciting.

65_Text=You can grow your own animal feed by growing grass on your farm.//<portrait=concerned>Has anyone told you about that?//<portrait=normal>It can save you a lot of money.
276_Text=You can’t have <NPCName>Bessie</>, though.//<portrait=normal>She’s my best friend.//<portrait=laugh>My <NPCName>Bessie</> friend!
150_Text=You definitely don’t want to smell me after work, though.
284_Text=You should eat lunch with me at the lake sometime.//<portrait=normal>It’s so peaceful there with the trees and the animals and everything.//I bet you’d like it.
338_Text=You should talk to <NPCName>Pablo</> about getting some upgrades done.//<portrait=normal>I know how hard you work.//Upgrades really make ranch work easier!
317_Text=You still have to get home, right? Be careful out there.//Nature is no joke.
226_Text=Your chickens can get really sad if you don’t feed them.//<portrait=concerned>The same goes for cows and other farm animals.

37_Text=<NPCName>Jack</> loves cooking.//<portrait=concerned>He’s very…experimental.
159_Text=<NPCName>Jack</> needs extra help stocking the shelves. Not a hard job, just time-consuming, that’s all.
29_Text=<NPCName>Kenny</> plays the flute, just like me… Correct.
1_Text=A farmer? Okay.//I’m <NPCName>Kira</>.
95_Text=A good investment in equipment can save you plenty in healing expenses later.//<portrait=normal>You never know what kind of monsters are down there.
3_Text=Anybody can play the flute. All you need to do is get yourself one and blow through the mouthpiece.
23_Text=Are you going to the cave or coming back?
148_Text=Bring me the monsters first. Okay?
52_Text=Can’t stand them anymore. I hate them now.
61_Text=Check often, will ya? I might have old things that I need to get rid of.
55_Text=Check on my board often.//I might have old things I need to get rid of.
10_Text=Check out my board. I’ll give you rewards when you slay certain monsters.

141_Text=Clean off the rust… Sell them. I don’t know.
68_Text=Come talk to me if you have questions about combat.
12_Text=Cooking isn’t for me. I’m more the flower-arranging type.
63_Text=Don’t you know about that?… Hmm… Odd. Well, now you do.
87_Text=Each will give you a different kind of protection and strength.//<portrait=annoyed>For combat. What did you think I was talking about?
85_Text=Figure out your strength. And bring some armor!
69_Text=Fishing? I don’t know much about fishing.
143_Text=Fodder? Food for animals? No, I don’t have any. You’ve come to the wrong place.
165_Text=Gah. You're one of those <Italic>chippery</> ones.
58_Text=Have you fought all of the monsters on my board?
46_Text=Have you fought all the monsters on my board?
161_Text=How’s the old cabin? Holding up okay?
153_Text=Huh? Who’s <NPCName>Charles</>?
64_Text=I can tell you some legends. What kind do you want to hear?
84_Text=I can’t really teach you combat. You just need to go out there and fight.
32_Text=I can’t wait for yoga on Saturdays. It’s a great reason to go to town.
163_Text=I don't really care about birthdays or parties in general.
67_Text=I don’t get involved in corporate drama. I’m focus my energy on the actual monsters that live in the cavern.
119_Text=I don’t mind being ignored… I prefer it, in fact.//How about I don’t bother you, and you don’t bother me?
154_Text=I don’t want to scare you, but you should keep those vitamins handy when you go into combat.
7_Text=I guess my wild days are over.
36_Text=I had <NPCName>Kenny</> when <NPCName>Jack</> and I were very young.//<portrait=happy>Oh, can you really tell?
101_Text=I had way too much pumpkin pie for dinner last night.
140_Text=I have to dig out some of my old blades one of these days.
133_Text=I have to get back to the cabin.
45_Text=I just got up. I could use a good stretch right now.
5_Text=I made my first flute myself. It was just a way to relax after a long day of combat.
44_Text=I still visit the cavern, but not a lot.
38_Text=I still wear my combat boots every day, just in case.
102_Text=I think I ate enough pumpkin pie for a year.//<portrait=normal>But I wouldn’t say no to more if there’s leftovers.
92_Text=I think I’ll stay in the forest today.//I don’t have any business in Starlet Town anyway.
130_Text=I think we all can use rainy days like this.
6_Text=I used to bring food and camp in the cave for days… Not anymore.
70_Text=If you feel like you’re going to pass out, stop and eat something.//It’ll make you feel better.
160_Text=If you need anything, you should talk to <NPCName>Jack</>. I don’t know much about selling these.
166_Text=It can be any date I want it to be.//What's with the personal question?
167_Text=It isn't listed. I don't celebrate it.//Personal reason.
11_Text=It makes my job easier.//Not so hard to understand, is it?
26_Text=It plays much better than my old one.
8_Text=It’s Tuesday?! No! Is it?
150_Text=It’s been empty ever since… Cobwebs. Rats. Gah.
4_Text=It’s easy to learn but really hard to master.
9_Text=It’s hard to keep track of the days, living so deep in the forest.
138_Text=It’s hard to succeed at combat if you’re not coordinated.
142_Text=It’s impossible to live alone without people bothering you, isn’t it?
132_Text=It’s too bright in here. The sun’s hurting my eyes… And it’s loud in here.
112_Text=I’ll go down to Starlet Town on the weekend. Now’s not the time.
137_Text=I’m going to buy the videos and do them at home. That way, I don’t need to come here.
151_Text=I’m here for a routine checkup. How else am I going to keep healthy?
136_Text=I’m here to learn how to stretch correctly.<NPCName>Leah</>’s learning from videos on the internet.//<portrait=happy>You heard about those?
51_Text=I’m sick of tortillas. That’s all I used to eat.//<portrait=annoyed>Tortillas this, tortillas that.
60_Text=I’m sick of tortillas. That’s all I used to eat.//<portrait=annoyed>Tortillas this, tortillas that.//Can’t stand them anymore. I hate them now.        
128_Text=I’m sure I’m not the only one who likes the smell of rain.
73_Text=I’m sure you have plenty of work to do to get the farm going again.
75_Text=Just like fishing… There’s no way around it.
33_Text=Lies. I do not like yoga Saturdays.//<portrait=normal>But <NPCName>Jack</> likes to go down to Starlet Town, so it’s worth the trouble… At least I get to see him happy.
96_Text=Listen to my advice or not. Do what you want.
93_Text=Maybe I‘ll go down there this weekend.//<portrait=normal>I like it better here anyway, away from loud…people.
129_Text=Mmm… You smell that?
134_Text=No combat this weekend?
131_Text=No need to water my garden today.
98_Text=Not vices, I guess. Things. We all have our things… Hobbies. Whatever.
17_Text=Oh! It isn’t. Today’s Friday. It’s hard to keep track of the days, living so deep in the forest.
39_Text=Oh, don’t be nervous.//Like you don’t know there’s a literal army of monsters under this island.
62_Text=Playing the flute can make your core stronger because it gives your lung a respiratory workout.
42_Text=Playing the flute makes your core strong because your lungs get a workout.
2_Text=See you around, kid.
56_Text=Some of my armor's getting rusty.
94_Text=Some of the weapons out there are pricey, but they’re worth it if you visit the cavern a lot.
97_Text=Some people fish. I slay monsters. We all have our vices.
13_Text=Sure, you can do both. I’m just not a good cook.
120_Text=Thanks. Now you should tell the other islanders that.//They seem to think I like visitors, for some reason.
149_Text=The barn’s kind of a mess… It hasn’t been lived in for years. <NPCName>Jack</> used to live there before we got married… Rotten now.
162_Text=The house?//<portrait=normal>Oh, the cabin, you mean? There are some people from the Band of Smile inside the guild.
66_Text=The mayor told us all about Pufferfish yesterday.
100_Text=The season has nothing to do with where the monsters are. They’re all there, just on different levels.//Why are you asking so many questions? You should just go and hunt already.
72_Text=The soil is softer now the ice has melted. I can only imagine how many weeds there must be on your farm.
59_Text=Then why are you here, kid?
76_Text=There’s different kinds of armor and weapons you can get, either by finding or buying them from merchants.
86_Text=There’s different kinds of armor and weapons you can get, either by winning a competition or buying them from the blacksmith.
152_Text=These folks seem to know what they’re talking about.//Especially <NPCName>Charlie</>… I like him. He’s the straightforward type.
155_Text=They help me recover instantly… Ask the doctors if you don’t believe me.
24_Text=Today? No, I don’t want to hunt today. Thanks… Actually, I like to hunt alone…
144_Text=Up there, see the barns? You can buy it there… You passed the building, kid.//<portrait=happy>Also, I’d go and see <NPCName>Charlie</> if I were you. Might need to get a checkup for that disorientation.
135_Text=Vacationing?
41_Text=We need to take care of them because they take care of us in combat.
57_Text=We need to take care of them just like they take care of us in combat.
65_Text=Well, that’s true, not a legend. Monsters and ghouls once took over the forest.//<portrait=normal>Nobody was guarding the cave, so they were everywhere. For a while, you couldn’t even go in the forest.
156_Text=Well, yeah, they don’t taste good, but we don’t get them for the taste.//We take medicine to get better, fast.
99_Text=What monsters you encounter depends on how deep in the cavern you go.
158_Text=When he was seven.
127_Text=Why are there so many things in this house? I never really noticed before.
16_Text=Why do you keep saying it’s Tuesday? It isn’t… It’s Thursday.
164_Text=Yeah, they're alright. Some people make such a big deal out of it.
146_Text=You can try using your farming tool to fight monsters, but I don’t know how far it’ll get ya.
43_Text=You didn’t know that?… Hmm. Well, now you do.
71_Text=You don’t want to pass out, because who knows what creatures are in the cavern.//<portrait=normal>They could steal your stuff.
139_Text=You have it, <PlayerName>$player</>! And I don’t say that lightly. Keep it up!
74_Text=You need to train more if you want to get better at combat.
157_Text=You sound like my son, <NPCName>Kenny</>.
25_Text=*<NPCName>Leah</> is ignoring you*
60_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> has a giant case of creepy dolls in the living room. Super weird. Not a great way to greet company, is it?//If she just kept them in the privacy of her room, that might be okay.
87_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> is a bit of an oddball, yeah. But she’s actually okay.
98_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> is a bit of an oddball, yeah.//But she’s actually okay.
8_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> isn’t my mom. Is that a surprise?//I mean, we look nothing alike!
71_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> makes such a big deal over Pufferfish moving here. Gosh!
85_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, you could probably use a cute jacket instead of…whatever that is you’re wearing.
19_Text=Ah, <PlayerName>$player</>… Do we have to talk about that?//I’m not interested in talking about fresh vegetables right now. Some other time?
12_Text=Ah, excuse me.
29_Text=Ah, yes, yes…
103_Text=And the weather isn’t too hot.
146_Text=And then dress them up in couture.//Doesn’t that sound fun?
106_Text=Are you going to have a booth at the Mooncake Festival this year?
144_Text=At first I thought it was a monster, but it turned out to be <NPCName>Taco</>… What a relief!
73_Text=Bananas are good for you, right?
107_Text=Can I take a picture of it? People love country festivals.
45_Text=Can we do this some other time? I’m not in the mood for chitchatting right now.
119_Text=Can’t you see it raining?
43_Text=Dad is a teacher, and guess what he likes. Apples!//Such a cliché.
56_Text=Dad loves coffee, though. That’s how he starts every day, with a big cup of hot coffee.//What about you? Are you the same?
84_Text=Dad used to make me do the pumpkin-smashing game when I was a kid…ugh!//<portrait=happy>I won a couple of times.
134_Text=Do I look okay today?
17_Text=Every time I run out of makeup, I have to order it from Pokyo...so upsetting//<portrait=angry>Ugh… Living here is so complicated.
68_Text=For my carefree, effortless look, I’m wearing light foundation and a touch of lip gloss today.//<portrait=happy>You like?
91_Text=Have you checked out the Pufferfish office?
125_Text=Have you ever been afraid your house might be destroyed by a storm?
69_Text=Have you heard about a drilling company opening an office here?
78_Text=I appreciate that you work hard, <PlayerName>$player</>, but my advice? You can still look after your appearance.
122_Text=I can’t wait until it stops. I’m just not the sit-around-doing-nothing type of girl, you know.
132_Text=I can’t walk in all this snow…
140_Text=I could eat ten of those. I probably shouldn’t, though.
131_Text=I could use some sun right about now.
18_Text=I don’t know how much longer I can survive living like this.
95_Text=I don’t know why else. I just like it, I guess… Why does it matter?
153_Text=I don’t know… You just seem tired, that’s all.
147_Text=I don’t like wearing my hair down. It always seems to get in the way.
126_Text=I forgot my umbrella. Argh…
115_Text=I forgot to get gifts for the twins. Maybe I should just give them to them tomorrow.
55_Text=I hate the smell of coffee. It’s so… I can’t find the right word…//Earthy? Bitter? Musty? Anyway…
58_Text=I have a lot of those. Trust me, I’m far from happy.
113_Text=I have to get myself a pair. So country… But I don’t know where I’d wear them.
114_Text=I haven’t gotten anything for the gift-giving on Sunday. Hmm…
102_Text=I honestly think Fall is the best time to vlog at the beach.//It’s way less crowded.
127_Text=I hope it stops storming tomorrow. It’s so boring staying inside all day.
47_Text=I learned that the right accessory can make or break an outfit.//It’s tricky, because you definitely don’t want to look tacky… Like you’re trying too hard.
83_Text=I like making Harvest Festival content. It’s one of the few good things about this…town.
81_Text=I need to prepare for the Spooky Day Festival. My followers love my posts about it.
123_Text=I really shouldn’t be out in the rain for too long.
110_Text=I spent two hours on my hair today, and the wind just blew all my hard work away.
145_Text=I think I’d like to adopt a cat and a dog someday.
59_Text=I think I’m going to take it easy today.//<portrait=concerned>It’s been a hectic day, and it’s only Monday.
27_Text=I try to spice things up and incorporate meditation into yoga too sometimes.//It gets boring otherwise.
79_Text=I try to take pictures with daisies in the background. They get a lot of likes.//<portrait=angry>But I won’t take any with that patchy grass. So shabby.
93_Text=I wanna challenge you to a game of mini golf sometime.
33_Text=If you think about it, I literally live inside art. That “mansion” has been around longer than any of us.//It was one of the first landmarks here, you know. That counts as art, right?
26_Text=If you’ll excuse me, I have to take some pictures… I’m on a tight deadline here.
70_Text=In Starlet Town! What could they possibly want with a small town like this?
75_Text=Is this… Is this your Spring look? How…country.
54_Text=It was so dull. But I think Mom’s busy schedule pays off…//<portrait=happy>Mom… She always wears the prettiest things.//In retrospect, I probably should’ve studied art like her.
72_Text=It’s all she talks about at the dinner table.
104_Text=It’s almost the first weekend of Fall already.//All my mutuals are going to be posting pumpkin pictures soon.
22_Text=It’s hard to film on the beach. Always so windy, and the ground is uneven. *sigh*

151_Text=I’m posting my health checkup video as soon as I get home.
30_Text=I’m really not in the mood, <PlayerName>$player</>.
52_Text=I’m self-employed.//<portrait=happy>What difference does it make? Look at how many people came today.
130_Text=Keep your body moving during Winter, <PlayerName>$player</>. It helps keep you warm.
74_Text=Let’s see, what’s a good Spring look? Something flowy, definitely. A nice pastel makeup tone. What else, what else…?//<portrait=angry>Are you eavesdropping on me? Of course. You would.
9_Text=Living right next to a lake isn’t that glamorous, honestly.//It can get really loud.
86_Text=Looks like even the snow can make you look cute.
53_Text=Mom took me traveling all over the world when I was younger, but there was always art-dealing or gallery opening galas… Work travel.
31_Text=My earrings were given to my grandmother by the duchess herself. They’re like a family heirloom.//Oh, you can tell?
105_Text=Oh gosh! Next week will be way too late. I need to find a pumpkin before Saturday.
13_Text=Oh, I’m afraid I can’t help you. I need to be going.
148_Text=People think it must be so great living right next to a park, but to be honest, it gets very noisy on the weekends.
82_Text=Personally, I don’t care about the competition between Starlet and Beluga at the Harvest Festival.//<portrait=normal>But my audience eats it right up. Strange…
136_Text=Please don’t touch anything.
24_Text=Please go away.
67_Text=Preposterous, right? I know I sound dramatic, but you know it’s true.
128_Text=Rain really makes you lazy, doesn’t it? Look at me!//I didn’t even bother putting on decent makeup today!
135_Text=Remember to moisturize after washing your hands. You don’t want chapped hands.
99_Text=Sometimes, it’s not bad to be an oddball. The world needs more of them.
2_Text=Tch. Out of all the places you could go, why on earth would you move here?
116_Text=The Coral Inn twins, of course. It’s their birthday today.
141_Text=The ceramic plates in this house are designer. We have to be extra careful with them.
133_Text=The snow is going to ruin my shoes.
96_Text=The whole island is gathering at the beach tomorrow to pick up trash.
142_Text=They belong in a glass cabinet, not in the sink all covered in grease and stew.
92_Text=They literally built a mini-golf course. Not bad, in my book.
143_Text=This one time, I made a video in the forest, and when I reviewed the footage, I saw I’d caught a slithering shadow.
76_Text=Ugh, Spring.
77_Text=Ugh, why are you so close to me? You smell like a farm.
111_Text=Ugh… So annoying.
89_Text=Ugh… Spring feels so long this year. I’m so ready for Summer.
150_Text=We need to spice things up a bit around here. It looks so dull and one-dimensional.
57_Text=Wealth isn’t everything, <PlayerName>$player</>.//It buys you better-tasting wine, softer cashmere gloves, but it really doesn’t buy you happiness.
34_Text=Well, I don’t know the whole story.//But <NPCName>Ling</> came here to carry out her study a long time ago, and the “mansion” was the only place for sale. So she bought it.
94_Text=Well, it gets stuffy inside… I prefer to work outdoors, in nature.//It’s a much prettier backdrop.
5_Text=What an eyesore that dumpster is. Ugh…
44_Text=What are you doing? I need to get going.
11_Text=What? I’m kinda busy here…
61_Text=Whatever floats her boat, I guess…
80_Text=With Fall fashion, it’s all about the layers, <PlayerName>$player</>. A jacket, a scarf, whatever you want. Oh, maybe not whatever <Italic>you</> want, if you know what I mean.
10_Text=Yeah, the lake is right there in front of my bedroom window…//It’s nice and <Italic>lively</>, I guess, if you want to look at it that way.
51_Text=Yes, always… I’m always on the move.//I get bored just sitting in one spot.
97_Text=Yes… Trash.
28_Text=Yes… What’s up?
117_Text=Yoga’s good for the soul, <PlayerName>$player</>. Haven’t you heard?
66_Text=You can’t get anything good around here. Not even a decent yoga mat.
63_Text=You can’t get anything good around here.//Not even a decent yoga mat.
6_Text=You know, that one in front of the vineyard.//Oh well. It is what it is.
152_Text=You look a bit under the weather.//<portrait=concerned>Maybe cut back a little on the farming.
149_Text=You need to join my yoga class sometime.//<portrait=happy>It’ll be fun!
1_Text=You said you were a farmer, right?//<portrait=angry>Humph, that explains the outfit. How cute.
48_Text=You seem to… Umm… Be doing just fine with it.
118_Text=You should do it more.
32_Text=You sure like to talk, don’t you?
112_Text=Your boots are so thick. They look super cozy, by the way… Are they designer?

9_Text=Ah, yes, I have no green thumb… No talent for growing plants.
28_Text=All the waiting around… It’s all for a fish. One fish. Yeah, can’t do that.
101_Text=Are you as busy as we are in Fall?//<portrait=concerned>It’s honestly such a pain. But it is what it is…
109_Text=Are you coming to Mother’s party? You should. We usually have an amazing spread and fun games all night.
38_Text=Are you submitting an order?
106_Text=Are you warm in those, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I think the sweater I’m wearing is sufficient for Fall .No need to wear thick coats just yet.
29_Text=Aren’t you supposed to be working?
17_Text=But I won’t. Well, technically, it’s more like I can’t. I have work that’ll keep me busy for at least the next two or three days.
56_Text=But does that mean my decision is merely based on convenience? Will I change my mind if, perhaps, I take flavor into account?
211_Text=Care for a drink, <PlayerName>$player</>?
128_Text=Cherry blossoms are so beautiful, yet their lives are so tragically short. Perhaps like life…
121_Text=Did you do anything fun to celebrate the New Year?
53_Text=Do you have a favorite grape?
184_Text=Do you have any cousins that you’re close with, <PlayerName>$player</>?//For some reason, snowy days always remind me of my cousins and that one eccentric uncle.
183_Text=Eh… I had no use for it, anyway.
143_Text=Errr… I have some heater recommendations, if you’d like.
151_Text=Excited for the New Year?
174_Text=Excuse me… I’m kind of in a rush.
123_Text=Gah… That was a bold statement, wasn’t it? I even surprised myself.
40_Text=Has anyone ever told you that you talk a lot? It’s a bit counterproductive when you’re trying to work.
150_Text=Have you checked them out? They’re fascinating, to say the least.//<portrait=normal>One time, I saw a puppet made out of wood with a coconut shell for a head. It was all dressed up. Very odd.
185_Text=Have you got one of those too?
19_Text=Have you seen the new item that I’ve got in stock?
199_Text=Have you tried the vineyard? He could be in the greenhouse.
140_Text=Her parents were okay with it. Our families are very close… Ah, fun times.
59_Text=Hmm… I may need to order some extra TVs to sell. They seem to be flying off the shelves.
48_Text=Hmm… I should wear a hat.
209_Text=Hmm… I think I’ll chill here today. I’m too tired to go to the tavern.
45_Text=How am I supposed to make a profit? I can’t increase my price.
32_Text=How are you, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Nothing much, thank you for asking.
120_Text=How do you even choose which ones to pick?
142_Text=How do you keep warm in your cabin on Fall nights?
25_Text=How’s your week been so far? You look like you haven’t slept much.
133_Text=Huh… I feel like you’ve asked me that already.//<portrait=normal>In any case, I find star fruit aesthetically pleasing, but a tad too bitter for my taste.
12_Text=I absolutely love Mondays. In fact, today is the most important day of the week for me. It’s when I recuperate from the weekend.
132_Text=I always do the same thing on Saturdays.//I suppose you’re right.
187_Text=I can feel the snow through my sweater, straight to my bones.
41_Text=I can never decide on my favorite grape. I want to say yuscat grape because you can both eat it and turn it into wine.
55_Text=I can never decide on my favorite grape. I want to say yuscat grape because you can both eat it and turn it to wine.
137_Text=I can’t believe next week is Fall already.
111_Text=I can’t wait for the Consumer Electronics Expo this Spring.//I wonder what <Italic>weird</> stuff they’ll have!
203_Text=I disagree. I believe, in this case, that honesty is the best policy.
171_Text=I don't like storms.
154_Text=I don’t care much about it, but it seems important to her. So, I’ll make sure to do it. At the end of the day, it’s the least I can do after all the things my parents have done for me.
3_Text=I don’t get why Mother keeps complaining about the recycling center. I walked past it yesterday, and it smelled fine.
118_Text=I don’t know about Pokyo, but deep-fried bananas are a thing around here. <NPCName>Joko</> loves them.
66_Text=I don’t know yet. I guess it depends on how many orders I receive and process today.
27_Text=I don’t like fishing. You just sit around doing nothing for a long time, waiting for a fish to take the bait.//Doesn’t seem productive to me.
4_Text=I don’t mind paying a little extra in tax if it goes directly toward fixing up the buildings around here. But that’s not always the case, and unfortunately I don’t agree with some of this town’s current spending.
163_Text=I don’t mind the rain today.
167_Text=I don’t mind the rain.
94_Text=I don’t think I’ve seen Father sailing since I was a boy. I haven’t gone in a while either.//<portrait=normal>Maybe I should ask him.
71_Text=I don’t want to alarm you, but you have to hear about this book. It claimed that a lot of different magical creatures used to live on this island.
160_Text=I feel a bit gloomy today.
182_Text=I found an onyx lying around in my cash register drawer one time. I gave it to <NpcName>Rafael</> and he was thrilled.
105_Text=I go to a small electronics store in Tosaka. It has lots of things I need.//You can check out their speakers from low end to high end. That way, you can compare them for yourself right there and then.//Size doesn’t matter when it comes to electronic stores.
63_Text=I grew my hair out one time, and it was very hot.
127_Text=I guess this’ll be the last week we can enjoy the cherry blossoms this year.
90_Text=I have to say, I’m enjoying Summer more than I expected…even with the bugs and all.
58_Text=I have to ship out tons of wine from the vineyard tomorrow at dawn. I got the paperwork done today, and hopefully the boat will arrive on time.
186_Text=I have two. One from each side of the family. Lucky me.
155_Text=I hope you’re going to the New Year’s Eve dinner at the vineyard.
61_Text=I just got this cool speaker in this week’s shipment. I’m going to test it out at <NpcName>Pablo</>’s and see if I should keep it or not.
206_Text=I keep my business relationships separate from personal ones. With good business partners, I can’t risk getting too close and harming the relationship.
88_Text=I know it’s Summer, but I can’t bring myself to wear shorts.//I live on a hill behind a vineyard… If I wore shorts, I’m afraid I’d get eaten alive by mosquitos.
75_Text=I like the sound of that!
189_Text=I make sure to bring lunch from home.
72_Text=I mean, maybe there was a Goddess. But mermaids? Not only mermaids, but a clan of them? It claimed an ancient kingdom of mermaids lived on Coral Island… Huh?
47_Text=I might go to the beach tomorrow. Visit the shack or something.
208_Text=I might go to the tavern later. I’m craving a big plate of pasta!
102_Text=I need to make sure we have enough time to process and ship orders before Winter hits.
57_Text=I need to think about this.
144_Text=I ordered some heaters for the ranch, and they haven’t arrived. Disaster!
6_Text=I read that the early civilization here used to farm together and share their harvest. It was the law of the land.
188_Text=I should have stayed home today.
24_Text=I think I’ll change my display today.
201_Text=I think he likes to live by himself.
31_Text=I think it’s equally important to work hard and to understand our limits.
14_Text=I used to work on Mondays, but there wasn’t much business.
69_Text=I was minding my own business at the library the other day, reading, and somebody tapped me on the shoulder.
70_Text=I was reading. At the library… Does that not show that I don’t want to be bothered?//A lot of us need to learn to read the room better.
100_Text=I wish I could spend more time at Sockets, but it’s harvest season, and the winery is just sucking up most of my time.
8_Text=I won’t be much use at gardening. I learned a thing or two from Mother, but I have no, umm… What do they call it?
107_Text=If you need more layers for Winter, White Flamingo usually has great sweaters.//I get mine from there… Though sometimes they have some questionable things…like giant animal onesies.//Fashion, I suppose. I don’t quite understand.
115_Text=If you need to buy seeds, go to Sam’s General Store. He carries a variety.
2_Text=Interesting… Moving to a small island from Pokyo is an odd choice.//<portrait=normal>And why now? But I suppose everyone has their own reasons.//Good luck with…things.
158_Text=It depends, I guess. I don’t mind it today.
168_Text=It isn’t too windy, and it’s not pouring rain. It’s sprinkling and cool, but not raining so hard that I have to put my rubber boots on.
7_Text=It probably worked because it was a much simpler time back then. Nowadays, to run something as simple as a community garden, I think we’d need some sort of permit. Hmm…
76_Text=It was literal trash. This is ridiculous!
81_Text=It's lively here on Saturday, isn’t it?
80_Text=It’s a jolly day, for sure. And I shall treat it as such. I’m done complaining for the week.
84_Text=It’s always cool to see new technology. That’s why the Consumer Electronics Expo is the <Italic>one</> event I’m looking forward to in Spring…//<portrait=concerned>Well, that’s not true. I also like the Cherry Blossom Festival.
23_Text=It’s distinctive, to say the least.
67_Text=It’s hard to decide on gifts. How do you know someone’s tastes haven’t changed since the last time you gave them something?
124_Text=It’s nearly the end of Spring already. I feel like I haven’t done much.
138_Text=It’s still so hot! It doesn’t seem to cool down one bit. Or is it just me?
141_Text=It’s the new season! I’ve got new items in stock.
149_Text=I’m always intrigued by the things <NPCName>Ben</> manages to find on his Fall escapades.
30_Text=I’m both for and against taking breaks from work.
82_Text=I’m feeling a little antsy. I think I’m just ready for Summer.
37_Text=I’m just going to take it slow today.
74_Text=I’m not one to care about farming or to poke around in other people’s personal lives. But how are things with you and your farm, <PlayerName>$player</>?
193_Text=I’m probably just going to eat my lunch in front of my computer and get things done.//No plans…
112_Text=I’m so glad Fall is over and done with. Now I can put more energy into Sockets.
104_Text=I’ve been knee-deep in reviews of this year’s Consumer Electronics Expo.//Definitely looking forward to the online end-of-year sale. There are things that I’d like to get my hands on.
194_Text=Just some green salad... Nothing fancy.
78_Text=Lamps and blenders? Is that what I’ve become to this island? Everyone just thinks of me as the lamp-and-blender guy.
146_Text=Look at how much snow has accumulated, and we’re not even a week into Winter.
198_Text=Looking for my father? Hmm… I honestly don’t know where he might be.
153_Text=Mother once told me that after I marry, she wants me to continue the family tradition, and she still expects me to spend New Year’s Eve with her, wherever I end up.
68_Text=My personal go-to for a gift is to buy them a meal from the tavern. If folks don’t like that, it’s nothing personal, right?
26_Text=My store is closed tomorrow. I usually do some bookkeeping at home instead.
65_Text=My weekend plans? Hmm… Good question.
21_Text=Not always, though. Might want to keep that in mind.
79_Text=Not my parents, though. To them, I’m the wine merchant.//I’m the one making sure their winery turns a profit. *sighs*
64_Text=Not that it looked hot. I meant “hot” as in body temperature.//It made me sweat a lot.
110_Text=Now that it’s Winter, there are massive electronics sales everywhere!//I might check out the electronics district in Pokyo. Let’s see how the week goes!
196_Text=Oh, darn! I forgot to shut my bedroom door.
35_Text=Oh, good Goddess! What happened to you? Did you get attacked?
36_Text=Oh, good! I just never really know with you, I guess. Because you always look so, um, casual.
192_Text=Oh, hey, submitting an order?
85_Text=One of the coolest things I saw at the Consumer Electronics Expo has to be self-driving cars… When they were first introduced.//I thought it was groundbreaking… Hmm…
51_Text=Only if you want to. You certainly don’t have to. But judging by the look of your boots, you already know that.
15_Text=People are too busy to shop at the beginning of the week, I suppose. So here I am.
190_Text=People ask a lot of questions without reading the user manual first.
125_Text=People tend to buy more outdoor grills this time of year. Maybe they’re getting ready for Summer cookouts.
95_Text=People who think tomato soup is best in Fall are clearly wrong.//<portrait=normal>Tomatoes are a Summer crop and thus best consumed during Summer.
108_Text=Phew, things have finally slowed down at the winery.//Mother can take care of the greenhouse, and all that’s left is filling orders and doing paperwork. Easy.
116_Text=Pufferfish Corporation owns that building, you know. We found out last Fall when we tried to lease the building for our tasting room.
49_Text=Running errands, are we?
18_Text=Shopping day? Tuesdays are when people usually shop and submit their orders.
114_Text=Shouldn’t you start farming or something?
77_Text=So sorry, <PlayerName>$player</>. That is so sad.
147_Text=So what are you going to do for the next three or four weeks, now that you can’t really farm?
62_Text=Sorry, I have a “no returns” policy at Socket. My supplier only gives me flexibility in my personal orders. Even then, it’s constrained to TVs and speakers, not kitchen appliances.
87_Text=Spring happens to be the beginning of the life cycle of electronics, like it is for many things in life and nature. It’s when new things are introduced to the market.//Exciting time for farmers too, I suppose. With the going back to farming and whatnot.
60_Text=TVs are expensive to stock, though. I’m not sure what to do. I find that people tend to buy more when I have TVs on display. The problem is, I don’t have actual data to back up my theory.
129_Text=That was a song lyric, wasn’t it?//From the Shell Rockers? Gosh, I love that band.
126_Text=That wasn’t a wild guess. I looked at the sales numbers. Well, in any case, it’s good for business.
46_Text=The islanders won’t be able to afford my items if I increase my price. I’d risk running out of customers, and then I would go out of business.
159_Text=The rain isn’t that bad. First of all, it’s not too windy, and it’s not pouring rain.//It’s sprinkling and cool, but not so heavy that I have to put my rubber boots on.
5_Text=The seasonal decorations, for instance… I don’t think we need to spend any more of the budget on that.
86_Text=The smart bathtub was amazing too. You set your preferred temperature, and it does everything for you.//It does the filling up, makes sure the temperature is perfect, and drains automatically when you’re done.
92_Text=The town is lively in Summer.//I like it.
148_Text=The vineyard will rely on the greenhouse. Our production is declining. But it’s on purpose.
16_Text=The weather is nice today… I should do things, like go to the beach or something. Feels like a waste otherwise.
119_Text=There are plenty of flowers around. You can find tulips and violets around the lake if that’s your thing.
89_Text=There aren’t any exciting announcements for electronics this Summer. All that was done in the Spring.//Let’s wait and see what the reviews say!
204_Text=There is no better way to spend the day than being outside, especially in weather like this.
205_Text=There’s so much more to running a vineyard than shipping wine. I have to maintain relationships with our buyers, which means inviting them over for dinner every once in a while.
44_Text=They just increased the price of ads. Again! Unbelievable.
117_Text=They rejected our offer without any explanation. Now we know why.
172_Text=They scare me a little.
83_Text=This year’s Consumer Electronics Expo was amazing. Too bad I could only stream it…//I wasn’t able to get tickets.
122_Text=Tomorrow is the Cherry Blossom Festival. I think it's the highlight of the year on Coral Island.
210_Text=Tradition is what links us to our past, and hopefully to our future as well.
52_Text=Ugh… I did it again. Sorry if I sounded condescending. I didn’t mean to.
22_Text=Ugh… You have quite a style.
113_Text=We do grow grapes in the greenhouse in Winter, but we don’t rely too much on them. They’re sort of like a backup supply.
103_Text=We do have a greenhouse where we grow grapes, but the taste never quite matches the grapes we harvest in Fall.//That’s just my personal opinion.
136_Text=We have a duty to take care of Mother Nature. If not us, then who will?
200_Text=We offered to let <NpcName>Ben</> stay at the house, but he refused.
166_Text=Well, you know what, <PlayerName>$player</>? I actually do mind the rain a little.
157_Text=Well… I actually do, a little.
135_Text=We’re cleaning up the beach next Saturday, <PlayerName>$player</>. Come prepared!
96_Text=What did you do in Summer when you were a kid?
91_Text=What is it about Summer that makes me want to pick up my clubs and go golfing?//It’s all those Summer camps my parents sent me to, I suppose. The memories stick.
73_Text=What’s next? A group of frogs ruling the country? I can’t decide if I’m amused or confused.
134_Text=Why do you care so much about star fruit?
191_Text=Why would they think I have better information than the literal user manual?
145_Text=Winter is around the corner. This is unprofessional! I should give them a call.
195_Text=With herbed tempeh and lemon dressing.
131_Text=Wow… The first week of Summer, and the mosquitos are already out in full force.
152_Text=Yeah, my family has a New Year’s Eve dinner tradition.//So, if nothing else comes up, we’ll probably just spend the day preparing for that.
99_Text=Yes, I did as well, in between Summer camps.//Unfortunately, some of them, like the tennis camp in San Franciskyo, didn’t let us bring any games.
98_Text=Yes, I did too. Sailing was nice. The sea is always one of my favorite places to be.//Tennis camps were fun. You’re gone for a whole season and come back improved by the time school starts.
1_Text=Yes? May I help you?//<portrait=happy>My name’s <NPCName>Luke</>. Pleasure is mine.
20_Text=You can see my commercial on TV every other day. But I usually only add new stock on the weekend.
97_Text=You can sleep in other seasons as well, you know. But I see your point.//I used to go to camps abroad, and sometimes, sleeping in wasn’t part of the package. Ha ha!
39_Text=You don’t have to, but you should.
178_Text=You have some snow on your clothes.
54_Text=You seem surprised. Why? Did I surprise you?
50_Text=Your boots are dirty, by the way. Perhaps one of these days you can go by the creek and clean them?
130_Text=[Luke hums a sad song by the Shell Rockers.]
142_Text=*nervous laughter*
133_Text=<NPCName>Erika</> is good at cutting curly hair.//She's the one taking care of mine.
131_Text=<NPCName>Eva</> and I wanted to throw a simple party for the twin's birthday tomorrow, but they said no because the New Year’s Eve party’s in two days.
149_Text=<NPCName>Kenny</> and I checked. <NPCName>Stephen</>'s first pair of swimmerets are pointy, so he’s a male.//Females have thin and feathery swimmerets.
50_Text=<NPCName>Luke</> hired me to take some pictures of the vineyard one time, and I fell in love with it.//<portrait=happy>It’s just so beautiful.
85_Text=<NPCName>Mr. Mayor</> hires me to document the festivals. He pays me pretty well.//Let’s see, up next is the Cherry Blossom Festival on the 10th…
160_Text=<NPCName>Stephen</> sure loves his tank… I spent my monthly grocery budget building that.//<portrait=happy>I lived by foraging and scavenging for the whole month.
33_Text=<NPCName>Stephen</>'s doing well today, thanks for asking.//<portrait=happy>What about you, <PlayerName>$player</>?
176_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>,<PlayerName>$player</>,<PlayerName>$player</>,<PlayerName>$player</>.
20_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>? Are you okay?
125_Text=A lot of cool things happen here in Winter.
180_Text=Amazing! I, like, never get to geek out about framing and cool lenses and stuff except on the internet.
123_Text=Anything cool going on today, <PlayerName>$player</>?
71_Text=Are you going to the beach or heading back home?
128_Text=Are you planting anything this Winter?
196_Text=Being a photographer means I have to be ready to whip out my camera at a moment’s notice.
87_Text=Besides, I don’t think it’ll be on consoles yet.//My laptop isn’t powerful enough to run it smoothly. Heh heh!
114_Text=Birds’ nests are always nice to spot. This one time, I took progress pictures of eggs in a nest until they hatched.
183_Text=Blah. I need more caffeine.
233_Text=Buh! The sun is so bright today, it hurts my eyes! But it’s such good lighting for photography…
213_Text=But if you look in the corner, you can see a cat with huge eyes, creeping up on him!
66_Text=But keep an eye out for flowers like lilies.//They bloom in more than one season… Summer and Fall, if I’m not mistaken.
120_Text=Can you believe it’s the eleventh already? Winter is literally right around the corner.
203_Text=Can you cook? Well, you’re a farmer; I’m sure you can. I can’t, though!
138_Text=Can you hold one sec? I’m in a boss battle.
221_Text=Chocolate sounds great right now.//<portrait=happy>I’d love some hot chocolate.
187_Text=Coral Island has some neat local legends. I wonder which of ’em are true.
106_Text=Coral Island is always beautiful, no matter the season.//<portrait=blushing>In Winter, the snow blankets everything and turns it into this serene, otherworldly island.
172_Text=Degrees and certificates aren’t everything. They help when you’re starting out, but I never took more than a few photography classes.
194_Text=Do ya like video games? It’s hard to find anybody these days who doesn’t at least play games on their phone.
189_Text=Do you ever miss your family back home? It’s nice to be free, but I still miss my parents.
164_Text=Do you feel a gust of wind? It’s making me feel sleepy.
178_Text=Do you have any photography experience, <PlayerName>$player</>?
211_Text=Do you like to dance, <PlayerName>$player</>? I know I do!//It’s great to let your energy out sometimes, even if you look goofy.
46_Text=Do you think it’s because I’m covered in dirt a lot? I always have this icky feeling that my room never feels clean, you know?//So I scrub and scrub and scrub… I don’t know if I’m making a lot of sense right now.
61_Text=Don’t worry! I’m not stalking you. Ha!//<portrait=normal>I go to the forest a lot too. It’s a great place to take pictures.
227_Text=Don’tcha just love that sea-salt scent? Ha! That’s fun to say. Sea-salt scent!
223_Text=Drinking coffee takes too long. Maybe I should just snort instant espresso powder.
110_Text=Every time I take a photo of the island in Winter, I think “Winter Wonderland.” It really is a wonder!
69_Text=Favorite video game genre? Hmm… Hard question. I like action-adventure video games.//<portrait=happy>They let me travel to a different world whenever I want.
36_Text=Game streaming seems like a fun thing to do!//<portrait=normal>But I can’t see myself doing that. I don’t feel comfortable being the center of attention.
124_Text=Get it? ’Cause it’s Winter… Cool…//<portrait=blushing>Heh heh!
166_Text=Getting here is an exercise by itself.
181_Text=Ha ha! Don’t worry, I do too. But that doesn’t mean you can’t learn to love taking them!
225_Text=Half the time when I make a joke, people assume I’m serious. I wonder why…
231_Text=Hang on, I need to change my lens.
116_Text=Harvest season is coming up, <PlayerName>$player</>. You’re about to get really busy, aren’t you?
1_Text=Hello to you too! I’m <NPCName>Macy</>.//<portrait=normal>Where are you visiting from? It’s nice to finally have a tourist in town.
179_Text=Hey, that’s fine!
171_Text=Hm. That’s not a lot, huh? It’s probably fine. Work-life balance is overrated.
230_Text=Hmm, how do I frame this… Landscape or portrait?
136_Text=Hmm… What should I have for dinner?
58_Text=Hmm… Where should I take <NPCName>Stephen</>, you think?
182_Text=Hold on. I just spotted an AMAZING shot!
193_Text=How goes the farming? Is it <Italic>farmy</>?
173_Text=I actually have a degree in finance! Funny, right?
239_Text=I bet I could get some awesome lightning shots if I were patient enough! But I’m tired…
51_Text=I bet your farm would be great to photograph!//<portrait=happy>Maybe when I have the time, I can stop by and take pictures of you in action.
41_Text=I call my parents every week to let them know I’m still <Italic>alive</>.//<portrait=happy>Ha! No joke. If I didn’t, they’d throw a tantrum like you wouldn’t believe! Drama monarchs…//<portrait=blushing>Love them, though.
104_Text=I can’t take <NPCName>Stephen</> for walks in Winter. It’s kind of sad, but he doesn’t like the cold.
151_Text=I come here when I feel like treating myself to a home-cooked meal and cold drinks.
63_Text=I consider them family.
94_Text=I do like taking beach photos in Summer. Is that too basic?
163_Text=I don’t get too stressed thankfully. I think it’s one of the advantages of this line of work.//I'm always surrounded by nature and pretty things. It puts me in good mood...always.
111_Text=I don’t get too stressed, thankfully. I think it’s one of the advantages of this line of work.//I’m always surrounded by nature and pretty things. It puts me in a good mood…always.
100_Text=I don’t have a favorite season.//I think Coral Island is a beautiful place, no matter what time of year… That’s why I moved here.
23_Text=I don’t know what to tell you.//I guess it’s just interesting to watch people play games.
31_Text=I don’t like the rain. I usually spend rainy days editing pictures at the library and just play video games in my room all night.
137_Text=I feed <NPCName>Stephen</> twice a day…//I wanna make sure he gets all the nutrients he needs, but I don’t want to accidentally overfeed him.
22_Text=I get bored quickly… I play video games when I’m tired of editing pictures…//<portrait=happy>Then, if I’m still bored, I watch other people playing video games.
214_Text=I got the shot just in time. I lowered my camera, and the bird shrieked and took flight!//<portrait=normal>It was hysterical.
199_Text=I guess you can also say it’s nice… Intimate, maybe?
167_Text=I had a big bowl of avocado for breakfast this morning.//<portrait=happy>What did you have?
222_Text=I had a video call with my parents today. They were happy to see me, and I was happy to see them.
218_Text=I had the weirdest dream last night. I was a pickle, and everyone was standing around me, laughing.
75_Text=I had the worst night last night. I think <NPCName>Valentina</>'s dad came to visit, and he was so loud in the lobby. I didn’t sleep very well afterward… Kept waking up, you know?
105_Text=I have <NPCName>Stephen</>'s tank heated during Winter. He’s a lot more lively when the water is warmer.//I wanna get one of those smart thermometers for fish tanks, but they cost too much… So, the manual one will do for now.
7_Text=I have a picture of the recycling center when it was half empty, if you want to check it out.
215_Text=I hope <NPCName>Stephen</>'s okay. Well, I’m sure he is, but I still worry.
93_Text=I know you can make fruit tarts whenever, but it always feels like a Summer dish to me.
53_Text=I learned photography from my mom. Why?
226_Text=I like coming here just to think about things. The ocean clears my head.
102_Text=I like taking photos of <NPCName>Stephen</> in Fall. His blue shell stands out so beautifully in the Fall colors.
84_Text=I like to take photos of the leaves as they grow. It’s beautiful and poetic, you know?//Yeah! It <Italic>does</> show progression.
91_Text=I like wearing boots. I know the weather is a bit…hot, but they give me great support for walking.//So I don’t accidentally stumble on some rock and fall while I’m holding the camera.
169_Text=I love it so far. I get to meet people with interesting stories and take pretty pictures of nature.
56_Text=I love taking pictures of nature and its ever-changing character.//It shows us a new face every day.
228_Text=I love the dim lights here. I can handle loud noises just fine; it’s my eyes that are too sensitive.
49_Text=I miss my family sometimes. My mom more than my dad, ha ha…//I love them both, though. Just…different connections.//You know?
188_Text=I need a lot of space. My freedom is important to me.
28_Text=I need to concentrate.
65_Text=I notice that different flowers bloom each season.//It's hard to pick a favorite with that many options.
64_Text=I noticed <NPCName>Eva</> likes to sew all kinds of clothes. She’s very skilled with her hands.//<portrait=happy>It’s so cool!
52_Text=I only take selfies for my parents when they want “evidence” of my travels.
143_Text=I pay yearly at the inn.//They give me a really good rate, and I take photographs for them for free.
39_Text=I prefer to be behind the camera.//<portrait=happy>Oh, don’t worry too much about me! I think I’m an okay-looking and interesting gal.//<portrait=normal>I just don’t like being photographed.
8_Text=I saw you clearing up debris on the lot near <NPCName>Erika</>'s house last week, and I called out to you.//<portrait=concerned>I don’t think you heard me, though… Unless…
44_Text=I scrub the floor with disinfectant. You could eat off it if you wanted to… Don’t, though.
147_Text=I search the beach every so often for injured animals.//Fortunately, I haven’t found any besides <NPCName>Stephen</> so far.
98_Text=I think Fall is just so pretty, no matter where you are.//<portrait=happy>But on Coral Island? It’s on another level.
45_Text=I think I might be overcompensating with all the cleaning.
79_Text=I think I’ll make pizza tomorrow for all the girls at the inn. It’ll be nice to catch up before the new week starts, I think.
82_Text=I think my favorite place to take photos in Spring is around the lake.//<portrait=blushing>The old temple just looks beautiful surrounded by cherry blossoms.
162_Text=I thought about becoming a farmer too, but I couldn’t see myself committing to staying in one spot for such a long time.
6_Text=I took pictures of the recycling center.//<portrait=happy>I want to document its stages and call the series <Italic>The Mess We Caused.</>
220_Text=I try to be friendly, but I want it to be on my terms!
168_Text=I used to work for a corporation, dealing with financial records, before I decided to try my luck at photography.
152_Text=I was told <NPCName>Frank</> cooks everything on the menu himself.
217_Text=I was working a corporate job like you for a while before I became a photographer!
92_Text=I wish it wasn’t so humid.
200_Text=I wouldn’t say I have any particularly close friends. But I’m not a loner, either.
17_Text=If I eat too much in the morning, I feel nauseated all day! So I just grab coffee and bread before I head out.
210_Text=If it’s one goose, two geese…why not one moose, two meese? I’m so confused.
122_Text=If my mom found out I was wearing shorts on a windy day like this, I’d be in deep trouble. He-he!
113_Text=If you pay close attention to your surroundings, you can spot wild animals on the island.
148_Text=Interesting question… <NPCName>Stephen</> is a male lobster. I’m pretty sure.
74_Text=It also makes me crave fruit tarts. Hmm…//The heat...not the mosquitos.
216_Text=It can take some time before you figure out what you want to do in life. It did for both of us, right?
135_Text=It looks quite muddy out there. I don’t wanna slip and fall.
115_Text=It took quite a while, but it was worth it.
108_Text=It's cold…but I like to wear shorts.//I move easier in them. You could say they’re less restricting.
202_Text=It’s a sensory thing! I just hate the texture of uncooked fruit, but once you bake it? Hoo!
70_Text=It’s escapism, so to speak.//<portrait=happy>Even if you have a great life, it’s still fun to explore the underworld or the galaxy sometimes, don’t you think?
156_Text=It’s much warmer here than at the inn.
236_Text=It’s so cold out there! I’d bundle up a little more if I were you.
99_Text=I’d say one of the hardest things about taking photos in Fall is getting the right composition.//<portrait=concerned>If I don’t do it right, all I get is different shades of brown. That’s a boring photo.
134_Text=I’ll just wait until the rain calms down a bit and take more photographs then.
15_Text=I’m a sucker for nature panoramas. There’s always so much to take in! So much to share.
18_Text=I’m collecting my thoughts. Hmm…//What is it?
78_Text=I’m getting along great with the girls at the inn. You know them too, right?
117_Text=I’m going to take it easy today. I’m still so tired from the beach cleanup.
224_Text=I’m kidding! I’m kidding!
195_Text=I’m not a hardcore gamer or anything, but I love indie games! They inspire me a lot.
16_Text=I’m not a morning person.//According to a study I read years ago, my chronotype means that my most efficient work hours are after 11 am.//<portrait=normal>Which I feel is very true.
42_Text=I’m secretly relieved when my friends cancel plans. Socializing is exhausting sometimes.//<portrait=normal>Keep it between us, okay?
89_Text=I’m so glad I live near the beach. I can take <NPCName>Stephen</> out whenever I want, and I can take beautiful sunset and sunrise photos every day.//Granted, I don’t do it, but I could if I wanted to!
112_Text=I’m starting to feel the heat.//And mosquito bites.
26_Text=I’m sure you’ve heard of the company, Pletty Inc.?//<portrait=happy>Yeah, that’s the site that sells my photographs.
209_Text=I’m wondering if I should expand my work to other things, though.//<portrait=annoyed>What if it gets boring? Buh!
68_Text=I’ve gained a lot of knowledge and insight into who people are by doing that.
27_Text=I’ve sold plenty of <NPCName>Stephen</>'s pictures, titled “Lobster,” “Cute Lobster,” “Lobster Day Out,” “Sea Life.”//<portrait=normal>Umm… What else… What else?
19_Text=I’ve sold tons of <NPCName>Stephen</> pics! He’s a real champ about it. Always photo ready!
204_Text=I’ve worked hard to give <NPCName>Stephen</> a good life.//Once he regrows his claw, though, I’ll return him to the wild.
161_Text=Just like university years.
177_Text=Just memorizing your name! I read somewhere it helps to repeat someone’s name while you look at their face.
12_Text=Living at the inn really limits the gardening I can do.//I want to plant cauliflower, okra, and all kinds of vegetables.
198_Text=Living on such a small island is weird. You eventually know everything about everyone.
29_Text=May I suggest you go back to work? So I can go back to focusing.
37_Text=Maybe if I get over that, I might just start streaming.//<portrait=blushing>He-he. I doubt it, though. I like being in the shadows too much.
205_Text=Mmm… I could really go for a snack right now.
208_Text=Most of my work so far has been nature photography, so I’m really good at framing that specific type of shot.
212_Text=My best pictures all play with composition in unexpected ways.//One of my favorites is of a bird of paradise, looking all regal.
234_Text=My head hurts… It’s the light. Ugh.
57_Text=My parents got me a TV as a gift. Can you believe it?//<portrait=normal>They know I like video games, and they knew I could use a new one. Sweet, isn’t it?
185_Text=My weekly walks with <NPCName>Stephen</> are important. He really seems to enjoy them.
13_Text=No fruit, though.//<portrait=concerned>It requires a lot more space, right? I don’t think I’m ready for that much commitment.
54_Text=No, she isn’t a pro. She just always takes the family pictures.//Weddings, birthday parties, trips to the zoo, first time walking, first haircut… You name it, she’s snapped it.
175_Text=Not that every picture I take here is a winner. Composition matters too. But still!
72_Text=Nothing much… I’m building up my portfolio. Who knows? One of these pictures might land me a gig.
80_Text=Nothing’s set in stone yet, though. For starters, I don’t even have any cheese.
121_Text=Oh my… I need to find my coat. It snows pretty hard here.
139_Text=Oh my… It’s storming really hard.
9_Text=Oh well. You seemed busy that day.
103_Text=Oh wow, it’s Fall already! The island is going to look so pretty with the orange leaves.
83_Text=Oh wow, it’s Spring already!//I’m excited to take <NPCName>Stephen</> out again and show him around.
95_Text=Oh wow, it’s Summer already! That means we’re gonna have a community beach cleanup soon. Should I take <NPCName>Stephen</> with me? Hmm…
109_Text=Oh wow, it’s Winter already! No wonder <NPCName>Stephen</> looks a bit lethargic.
2_Text=Oh! You just moved to Coral Island?//<portrait=normal>That’s amazing, welcome, and confusing. Why? Well, I hope you’re getting around all right.//Coral Island is kind of big, so getting your bearings can be pretty hard at first.
192_Text=Oh, <NPCName>Stephen</> is my only pet. Any others, and I’d worry myself half to death!
90_Text=Oh, <NPCName>Stephen</> loves Summer! He’s always so happy when I take him for walks on the beach.
76_Text=Oh, well. It’s a small price to pay to live in a society. I could live in the middle of nowhere like <NPCName>Emma</> and <NPCName>Dippa</>, but I choose not to.
132_Text=Oh, well…
127_Text=Oops, I mean the twentieth… My, oh my… I’m really excited.
170_Text=Other interests? Uh. Um. I like video games! And I like people. And I like my rescue lobster, <NPCName>Stephen</>!
184_Text=Our world really is beautiful. Preserving that beauty is a worthwhile pursuit.
219_Text=People always expect you to be constantly friendly and upbeat.//It’s exhausting.
97_Text=Pizza is food for all seasons.//Chilly Winter night? Good! Hot Summer like today? Very good!
55_Text=Pizza? Oh yeah. I love it!//<portrait=normal>It’s delicious. You can have cheese, vegetables… Mmm! Yummy.
206_Text=Pretty much everyone in town has given me permission to take pictures of them.
32_Text=Rain doesn’t seem to bother you, though, huh?
38_Text=Saturday evenings? I spend them at the Tavern.//I don’t have a set schedule during the week… I usually just let the camera take me wherever.
237_Text=So much snow! Wish I had taller boots. My socks are getting soaked.
25_Text=So usually, I take pictures, then submit them online for licensing.//People then buy the right to use my image through a third party…//<portrait=happy>This website where I submit my photographs.
107_Text=Sometimes I worry something’s wrong with <NPCName>Stephen</>, but then I remember it’s Winter, and he’s just going to be less active than usual.//Do you think I should have <NPCName>Yuri</> check him out?//Can she even…?
81_Text=Spring colors are gorgeous here.//It’s my time to farm photos!
130_Text=That’s great, <PlayerName>$player</>. It’s good to take a break once in a while and just enjoy this island. After all, isn’t that why we’re all here?
88_Text=The Summer photos of Coral Island are pretty popular. I mean that’s what you usually want to see from an island, right?//<portrait=blushing>Cheerful Summer vibes!
126_Text=The Winter Fair is on the twenty-first, for one.
62_Text=The girls at the inn always suggest getting dinner together.//Little things like that make me feel right at home.
232_Text=The light on the sea is perfect. <PlayerName>$player</>, look at that!
43_Text=The mess is what’s making my room feel dirty. But in all seriousness, it actually isn’t. I’d say it’s immaculate.
144_Text=The photos cost me close to nothing, so living here is dirt cheap at the end of the day.
145_Text=The sand can be scorching on bare feet.
40_Text=The spotlight makes me nervous.
140_Text=The wind is a bit scary, isn’t it?
207_Text=There are a few exceptions! All for good reasons.
24_Text=There are a lot of picturesque spots here. Um…
157_Text=There are plenty of nature and photography books here for inspiration.
229_Text=There are some awesome photo books here. <NPCName>Millie</> got some just for me! She’s a real doll.
73_Text=There sure are a lot of mosquitoes here. I think the heat just makes them worse.
86_Text=There’s a new <Italic>Resident Vile</> game coming out this Summer.//I don’t think I’ll get it, though… No time to play.//I think I’ll just watch someone stream it or something.
158_Text=There’s information about farming and fishing too, isn’t there?
101_Text=There’s so many fun activities at the Harvest Festival.//<portrait=surprised>And so many fun things to take photos of!
197_Text=There’ve been dozens, if not hundreds, of shots that got away. They haunt me, <PlayerName>$player</>. They haunt me.
146_Text=This beach is where I found <NPCName>Stephen</>… Right over there, in fact!//He lost a claw, so I’m providing him a safe place to regrow it.
77_Text=This goes without saying, but please don’t tell anyone. I don’t want to make a fuss over nothing.
174_Text=This island is so beautiful. It’s hard to take a bad photo!
141_Text=To be honest, I’m a bit concerned about this storm.//It’s been windy all day, and the deck isn’t exactly brand new.
59_Text=Umm… It has to be close to the sea, though.//<portrait=normal>The lake is out of the question. I don’t think he’d be too happy with fresh water.
119_Text=Umm…the Harvest Festival on the fifteenth is the next one.
118_Text=We don’t have anything going on until the third week of Fall.
186_Text=What is it?
14_Text=What pictures sell the best? Oh, easy! People eat beach stuff right up. It’s the easiest money I’ve ever made!
238_Text=When it storms, it literally goes all day. How do the clouds not run out of water?
165_Text=Where’s the wind coming from anyway? Hmm…
129_Text=Whoa, it’s a busy year for you. Must be tiring to be farming all year round.
153_Text=Why would you wanna cook if you can get someone to do it for you, right?
96_Text=Would it be okay if I take photos of you during the community beach cleanup?//I take photos for the event… Just wanna make sure I have your consent.
235_Text=You can get some really compelling shots in the rain… other times, it’s just kinda drab.
67_Text=You can get to know people very well by just letting them talk.//People tend to like talking about themselves if you let them.
159_Text=You can nap here, and as long as you don’t snore, I think you can get away with it.
30_Text=You can try going to the library. Or meditation, maybe.
60_Text=You go to the cavern a lot, don’t you? I always see you there.
201_Text=You know what’s funny? I don’t like raw fruit, but I love, love, love baked fruit.
21_Text=You seem distraught. If there’s anything you want to say, please feel free to say it.
3_Text=You’ll get used to it in no time. I have no doubt.
190_Text=You’re…in my way. Move, please.
150_Text=[<NPCName>Macy</> is dancing.]
13_Text=...//The birds are back. They're very calming.
8_Text=...//What are you doing here on a Thursday?
2_Text=Are you always this chatty?
17_Text=Breathe that Winter air in, <PlayerName>$player</>.//That's what'll toughen you up.
9_Text=Can you believe this heat? I’ve never sweat so much in my life.
22_Text=Fall here is safe. The temperature isn't too hot.//In some areas, this is when they're prone to wildfires.//I've ran away from several of those myself.
23_Text=Favorite season? I don't have any.//All season is the same. We make too much fuss about them.//The temperature changes...no big deal.
20_Text=Fishing isn't my thing. I can if I had to of course.//<portrait=annoyed>What type of people can't fish or make their own food.
11_Text=I can use some homemade tomato soup.
5_Text=I don't go to the cavern unless I have to.//I have no reason going in there since I don't mine or collect artifacts.
4_Text=I would set all the animals at the shelter free, if I could. But that wouldn't be safe for them.//They're not trained for wild life.
12_Text=Kinda nice to see you out during this harsh weather.//<portrait=normal>Doesn't look like it bothered you too, huh?//Nice...nice.
3_Text=Lots of people in this area grow their own food.//There is a small garden in front of the guild...and my uncle also seems to grow things.
15_Text=Need to put out more waters for the animals.
18_Text=Not keeping any weapons at home, no.//I live with my small niece, <NPCName>Zoe</>. I don't want any accidents or nothing like that.
10_Text=People here seem to like Spring weather.//They mention it a lot.
7_Text=Pokyo has a real problem with strays. Their shelters are overcrowded.//Sometimes they send animals here to give them a better chance of being adopted.
6_Text=So you came here from Pokyo, huh?
21_Text=The hotspring is free. I wonder why not more people go there.
16_Text=This? Hot?//<portrait=normal>Maybe a bit, but nothing unbearable.
1_Text=What do you want?//I've got no business with you.
24_Text=Why are you talking to me here…in the middle of the rain?//What’s so important, <Italic>garden rake</>?
14_Text=Wouldn't it be better if it was Winter all year round? Maybe I should move farther north.
19_Text=You need a pair of nice sturdy boots to walk around in the rain.//My boots save me from slipping one too many times.
22_Text=<NPCName>Randy</> asked me to collect some articles for the kids. Additional reading and such.
25_Text=<NPCName>Scott</> doesn’t work on weekends.//Honestly, I don’t think he needs to!
27_Text=<NPCName>Scott</> doesn’t work on weekends.//Honestly, I don’t think he needs to! We have the museum under control.
121_Text=<NPCName>Tin</> isn’t really a pet, just a very well-behaved lizard that sometimes comes and hangs out with me.
173_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>… Do you think I talk about books too much?
82_Text=A lot of people get the sniffles this time of year.
78_Text=A steaming cup of coffee or tea, something to write with, the snow fluttering, and the fireplace roaring…//<portrait=blushing>Doesn’t that sound great?
74_Text=Ah, dear Fall. How I’ve missed you.
50_Text=Are we finally going to discuss “The Tale of Dulcans”?//<portrait=normal>Have you finished reading the series yet?
114_Text=Are you looking for a specific book?
56_Text=Are you planting any melons on your farm?//Oh, right! Melon is a Summer crop, isn’t it?
108_Text=Because it sure does feel like it to me.
14_Text=Biology has always interested me, especially wildlife.
185_Text=Brrrr! It is simply freezing today.
132_Text=Cooking can be fun. You can get all the fancy gadgets and try out new recipes.
95_Text=Do I do things differently in Winter?//Hmm, good question.
181_Text=Do you suppose it storms more in Spring? It seems that way to me.
183_Text=Do you suppose it storms more in Summer?
107_Text=Does it feel like it storms more in Spring?
109_Text=Does it feel like it storms more in Summer?
117_Text=Don’t you just love the smell of old books?
151_Text=Earlier, I spotted some crows near your farm.//I hope you have scarecrows, <PlayerName>$player</>, those birds eat crops, after all.
167_Text=Even crows! They get a bad rap, but they’re fascinating, intelligent creatures.
57_Text=Every Spring I always think of poor <NPCName>Charles</>. He’s always sneezing as soon as the pollen goes airborne.
99_Text=Excuse me.
23_Text=First editions are incredibly valuable! Well, to me, anyway. Generally, that’s where the author’s original ideas shine the brightest…alongside its typos.//<portrait=happy>Heh heh!
133_Text=Going diving, <PlayerName>$player</>?
162_Text=Have you finished reading <Italic>The Tale of Dulcans</>?//<portrait=normal>I can’t wait to discuss the symbolism with you!
2_Text=Have you met everyone?
99_Text=Have you noticed the weather channel isn’t always accurate?//It makes it hard to plan my days out.
141_Text=Have you read anything interesting lately, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I’m always looking for recommendations.
11_Text=Hmmm… I think I’ll go to the forest to gather fresh fruit on Thursday.
166_Text=Hmm… After giving it some thought, I don’t think I have a favorite bird.//<portrait=normal>I love all birds equally!
148_Text=How is life at the farm, you elegant butterfly?//<portrait=happy>Good? Good!
20_Text=How’s life at the farm, you adventurous sword-toting eagle?
120_Text=How’s your lizard knowledge, <PlayerName>$player</>? <NPCName>Tin</> hasn’t been showing up much lately.//I’m getting worried.
139_Text=How’s your week so far, you elegant butterfly?//<portrait=happy>Good? Good!
90_Text=I avoid the beach during Summer because the heat can be too much for me.
60_Text=I can feel the air slowly heating up.
124_Text=I can’t "legally operate machinery" without them according to the law.
54_Text=I can’t think of anything worthwhile to say.//My brain is clogged.
102_Text=I don’t feel like going anywhere today.
177_Text=I don’t go to the forest much.//I suppose I’m not much of a hiker.
143_Text=I don’t often sort my recyclables, though.//<portrait=normal>I’ll make a point to do it when the recycling center is built.
67_Text=I feel like I romanticize Fall a bit too much.//<portrait=blushing>But don’t you agree there’s something beautiful about writing a novel as the leaves fall around you?
122_Text=I get here before 10 am almost every day. I like to be punctual.
81_Text=I got my flu shot early this year, so I’m all set.
96_Text=I guess not.//<portrait=normal>I like my life in the library, but I do visit the beach from time to time.
157_Text=I have a good life, all things considered.//I want for very little.
21_Text=I help the mayor as much as I can with festivals, fairs, and such.//Still, I wish I could do more for the town…
88_Text=I hope <NPCName>Sam</> has blueberries. I’m craving some Summer fruit pies!
176_Text=I hope <NPCName>Sam</> has blueberries. I’m craving some Summer pies!
101_Text=I hope it stops raining soon.
170_Text=I just can’t find any inspiration. My mind is thoroughly clogged.
156_Text=I know I talk a lot about birds, but I’m fond of butterflies as well.//<portrait=happy>All lovely winged creatures captivate me!
168_Text=I know they’re a hassle to farmers like you, but please be humane with them.
7_Text=I like hanging out at work, so I usually stay here until I get sleepy.
145_Text=I like to start the day slowly with a book and a warm mug of coffee.
39_Text=I love worn-out books. To me, they speak of love and appreciation.
89_Text=I love writing and reading...sucker for romance fiction here, but I’ll read anything.//<portrait=normal>I won’t say no to a book.
47_Text=I manage both the library and museum here in Starlet Town.
51_Text=I might try diving tomorrow! If I don’t lose myself bird-watching, that is.
186_Text=I must say, I’m looking forward to Spring.
84_Text=I need to get my Summer reading ready!
35_Text=I once read that some plants survive two seasons…//That must be very economical for business, I would think. Less money spent on seeds.
43_Text=I pass by your farm sometimes, and I must say, there’s no better view of the sunrise.
98_Text=I plan to get some writing done today. I’m inspired by the rain.//<portrait=normal>It makes me feel contemplative.
180_Text=I plan to get some writing done today. The rain inspires me, after all!//So somber, so gloomy.
91_Text=I prefer the beach in Winter, to be honest… Thick jacket and chilly wind.//Best combo.
178_Text=I prefer to walk on proper roads.//But in your line of work, walking through the dirt seems unavoidable!
171_Text=I really do think the Starlet Digest has had its run.//You know, the newspaper.
134_Text=I should go home soon. I need time to make dinner.
163_Text=I suppose you know how it feels to yearn for a change of pace.//You left everything behind to come here, after all.
16_Text=I take Thursdays off.//I'll be at the library first thing tomorrow morning.
138_Text=I tell you, when I see a beat-up first edition in need of care, it makes my week.
63_Text=I was thinking about baking my own cookies for my library’s stash. For the kids, obviously.//<portrait=happy>Instead of buying them from <NPCName>Sam’s</>.//<portrait=normal>But in this heat? I don’t think it’s worth the money saved, am I right?
77_Text=I wonder how many great authors write in the dead of Winter.//It feels like the perfect season for writing. I prefer writing in Fall myself, though.
184_Text=I wonder if Sam’s is open today, what with the awful weather.//I’m running out of milk and fruit.
87_Text=I wonder if Sam’s is open today. I’m running out of milk and fruit.
45_Text=If you have anything to donate, please send it over to the museum. We have a donation box there.
61_Text=Is it too early to start looking for melons at <NPCName>Sam’s</>? Hmm…
128_Text=It feels too cold to go to the beach. I think I’ll go home after this.
17_Text=It turns out I’m not a big fan of the beach…//<portrait=normal>I like to admire it from afar, preferably with a cold drink in hand.
44_Text=It’s a magnificent piece of land. But it must be quite a lot of work to maintain!
165_Text=It’s even worse when it seems like the series will never be finished… What do I do then?
92_Text=It’s freezing today.
172_Text=It’s not worth much. Just recaps, news everyone already knows.
80_Text=It’s the Cherry Blossom Festival tomorrow.//I think I’ll bring some vegetables… I’m not sure yet.
8_Text=I’d rather spend my time at the library than at the house. I mean, why wouldn’t I?
94_Text=I’ll miss the snow, though.
68_Text=I’m always inspired to write more in Fall. I wonder why that is…
135_Text=I’m cooking fish tonight!
69_Text=I’m craving some ramen right now. Any kind of ramen. Mmm…
13_Text=I’m grateful for all the donations the library receives. Not just books, you know. We get plenty of money as well.//Some donations even come in from neighboring islands.
130_Text=I’m here to pick up some fresh fish for dinner.//I’m thinking about cooking fish tacos tonight… Hmmm?
137_Text=I’m hoping we get more first-edition books!//<portrait=normal>Book restoration is a hobby of mine.
93_Text=I’m looking forward to Spring.
58_Text=I’m starting to see a lot more lizards out and about. Even my lizard, Tin, is a lot more active now.
159_Text=I’m sure a lot of our customs will become clearer with them in mind!
70_Text=I’ve been doing a lot of communication with Beluga Bay, since we’re the one hosting the Harvest Festival.
76_Text=I’ve been eating too much ramen, but I can’t help myself!//<portrait=happy>I love the soupy goodness during the frigid Winter.
53_Text=I’ve been trying to write one article this whole day.
169_Text=I’ve spent the whole day grappling with a single article I need to write.
174_Text=I… Hmm. No, I suppose I don’t. My apologies for bothering you.
160_Text=Let me know if you ever want a book recommendation.//<portrait=normal>I often suggest books to townsfolk!
71_Text=Mayor <NPCName>Connor</> is really itching to win the harvest display this year…and me too!
38_Text=My favorite genre has to be romance. The good ones can really draw you in emotionally.
150_Text=My favorite genre is probably romance. The good ones inspire so much emotion that I feel exhausted when it’s over!
4_Text=Nah, not today. Maybe I’ll do it when the recycling center is built.
30_Text=No, she doesn’t give me a discount at the clinic.
75_Text=Now it’s Winter, I can finally relax a bit.
161_Text=Now, what’s a free-roaming butterfly like you doing in here, <PlayerName>$player</>?
29_Text=Oh gosh… Sometimes I read too long. Then I get that dizzy feeling when I stand up… Do you know what I’m talking about?//<portrait=concerned>Good thing my housemate is a doctor.
152_Text=Oh! I also saw some parrots!
12_Text=Oh! Or maybe I’ll go to the beach instead! Pack a lunch, bring some books, and soak up some sun.//<portrait=normal>Mmm…decisions, decisions.
83_Text=Oh, my! Is this the last week of Spring already?
127_Text=On your way to town, <PlayerName>$player</>?
164_Text=Once in a while, I get invested in a series of novels, only to find that the author hasn’t completed it.
116_Text=Once you donate a certain number of items, you’re welcome to collect your reward.
37_Text=Once you donate to the box, I file all the information before we can start the inspection process. As soon as that’s done, <NPCName>Scott</> takes care of the rest.
46_Text=Once you donate to the box, I file all the information before we can start the inspection process.//As soon as that’s done, <NPCName>Scott</> takes care of the rest.
131_Text=Or I can just buy a premade meal.//It’s much easier, and I know it’ll be good. Guaranteed.
110_Text=Or is it just me?
179_Text=Please be careful with the books here. Some of them are very old and very delicate, so wet hands can damage them.
97_Text=Please be careful with the books here.//Some of them are very old and delicate, so wet hands can damage them.
64_Text=Pufferfish is opening a stand at this year’s Beach Cleanup Festival. *sighs* It’s kind of hard to say no to them.
140_Text=Reading truly is a marvel. How else can we connect so intimately with people across time?
146_Text=Restoring books is a hobby of mine.//Making covers, taking care of old books… Little things like that make my week.
3_Text=Should I stop by the dumpster and sort the recyclables, you think?
34_Text=So many books and so little time.
123_Text=Some people think that my glasses are fake. They aren't!//<portrait=normal>They are for fashion, sure! But my eyesight can also use a little help.
62_Text=Summer can get pretty stuffy.//<portrait=happy>Thankfully, I live on Garden Lane. It’s so green and lush. Once you open the window – wah… The breeze is amazing!//<portrait=normal>It’s the base camp for bugs, though. I bet you can catch a lot of them there, am I right?
129_Text=Thankfully, it’s nice and warm in here.
175_Text=That’s so sweet of you to say! Thank you. I needed to hear that.
40_Text=That’s what books aspire to, right? To be read over and over again, by many people.
55_Text=The Cherry Blossom Festival is one of my favorite festivals, for sure.//<portrait=normal>The beautiful trees, the people coming together to cook delicious food… It’s so wholesome.
72_Text=The Harvest Festival is one of the more complicated festivals to set up, but I always have so much fun during the festival.//<portrait=happy>It feels like a reward for all the hard work!
79_Text=The best thing about having a doctor as a roommate is I can just ask her to do my checkups at home.//<portrait=normal>I still have to pay her, though, which is fair enough.
115_Text=The farming books are over there.
66_Text=The grass is looking kind of sad, isn’t it? That lot next to my house looks so dry.//So yellow… Poor things.
125_Text=The lights here are funny. I think the wiring must be old and needs some work.//<portrait=annoyed>Sometimes they go off and on by themselves.
158_Text=The local legends of this island are rather captivating.//You ought to read up on them, if you haven’t already.
153_Text=The townsfolk are quite eager to help out around town, especially with changing the seasonal decorations.
100_Text=The weather channel isn’t always accurate.
24_Text=Think about it. The very first version of a book that greets the world.
15_Text=This is the perfect job for me. It lets me catch up with my reading in between organizing.
155_Text=This island’s wildlife never ceases to amaze me. So much gorgeous fauna!
154_Text=Though I must admit, the decorations are my favorite part, too!
182_Text=Though I suppose lightning storms are still more common in Summer…
187_Text=Though I’ll miss the snow…
52_Text=Time certainly flies when you’re having fun.
59_Text=Tin likes to be out and about. He rarely stays inside his little glass room, that one.//An adventurer!
142_Text=Tomorrow is my recycling day! Scheduling chores helps me remember to do them.
73_Text=Until we meet again, sweet, sweet Fall air…
119_Text=We got several donations from <NPCName>Zarah</>.//She worked with us a couple of times to find some lost treasures.
9_Text=We have a large selection of books here. Feel free to browse around.
136_Text=We have a large selection of books here. Take your time browsing!
149_Text=We have several rows of first editions here. They’re the library’s most precious assets, at least to me.//<portrait=happy>Some are even signed by the author!
28_Text=We have the museum under control.
65_Text=We ran out of melons yesterday. I wonder if <NPCName>Sam</> still has some…
49_Text=What’s a butterfly like you doing in here, <PlayerName>$player</>?
6_Text=When we have a community garden, I’ll plant a lot of flowers.//<portrait=annoyed>Won’t be able to help out with gardening except on Thursdays, though.
118_Text=When we receive a new shipment of books, I like to do the unpacking myself.
1_Text=Yes, <PlayerName>$player</>!//<portrait=normal>I’ve been meaning to meet you. My name is <NPCName>Millie</>.//It’s so exciting to have people moving in.
113_Text=You can read about fish here. There are plenty of informative books about when to catch them.
126_Text=You can see all kind of butterflies and birds from here.
185_Text=I’m all she's got. I feel bad, but I also don't want to force her to move here with me.
132_Text=<NPCName>Bree’s</> parties are always so much fun, aren’t they? Nowhere near as much fun as Mother’s, of course. It’s too bad you haven’t been to any.
114_Text=<NPCName>Walter</> and Father used to take <NPCName>Luke</> and me sailing the first weekend of every Summer.//<portrait=sad>Eventually, we stopped that tradition, and then Father, well…
197_Text=Ah, I rarely spend my days at home… The whole living alone thing gets boring fast, so I come here instead.
148_Text=Ah, the wind is nice and breezy today!
92_Text=And Father was laid to rest here.
125_Text=Around this time of the year, Mother always made sure we were ready for our annual skiing trip.//<portrait=annoyed>I’m not very good at it… It never really <Italic>hooked</> me, as it were.
165_Text=Bad luck, I suppose.
113_Text=Can’t believe that crybaby grew up to be so tall.
185_Text=Close to Father.
178_Text=Come on! Show me what you’ve got.
17_Text=Coral Island feels the most like home to me. I feel like packing up and moving right back in, this Winter!
39_Text=Coral Island feels the most like home to me. I feel like packing up and moving right back in.
176_Text=Did I really call him “Dad”? Hah! That’s new.
120_Text=Do you think Luke will still let me put flower crowns on him?//<portrait=normal>Probably not, huh?
50_Text=Falling asleep with my windows open is the best. The sound of the ocean is so relaxing.
171_Text=Father used to take me here after hours to get a treat.
117_Text=Father was the one who taught me how to surf and sail. Well…not personally. He was too busy for that.//But he was the one pushing for lessons and camps.
179_Text=Father would flip if he knew that I cut my hair short like this!
58_Text=For my seventh birthday, Father got me a small patch of land over at Turtle Island. Our family uses it for berry planting.
97_Text=Growing up, I felt like I didn’t resemble either of my parents. I know it’s nothing, but it made me feel like I didn’t fit in.
152_Text=Ha ha ha. Silly, I know.
67_Text=Ha ha… Never mind. I think I’ve been reading one too many mysteries.
180_Text=Ha! Kidding. He wouldn’t! Father wouldn’t care. He would literally let me do whatever I wanted… And I did.//Mother was angry every time I threw dinner plates across the table. But not Father.
87_Text=Happy Sunday to you!
20_Text=How are you doing today, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>?
163_Text=Humph. Oh well… It’s only water, right? So what if it’s a little muddy?
167_Text=Humph. Oh well… The rain is only water, right? So what if it’s a little muddy and thundery?
130_Text=I can’t wait for the New Year’s Eve Festival!//<portrait=normal>I definitely missed it when I moved away.
143_Text=I could never, anyway. It’s my childhood home. There’s no way I can ever destroy or sell the villa.
4_Text=I could sell the whole house, and I swear to you, new things would still keep popping up. Ha!
22_Text=I don’t know what I’m rooting for just yet, but I am! Go, <PlayerName>$player</>!
195_Text=I don’t need most of the items here… My family has so much unnecessary stuff.
9_Text=I don’t need most of the items in my house. It’d be best for me to rehome the art and the furniture, but it really isn’t that simple.
186_Text=I don’t see kids building elaborate sandcastles anymore.
123_Text=I forget how pretty Coral Island is in Autumn. It’s just so picturesque with all the falling leaves.
95_Text=I get confused when people ask me where I’m from. Coral Island is definitely home to me, so I always tell them that.
155_Text=I got my party planning gene from Mother.//My family used to have parties where Mother would invite everybody on the island for my birthday.
108_Text=I hate Spring cleaning.//<portrait=surprised>I should ask <NPCName>Suki</> to do it. She LOVES Spring cleaning.
99_Text=I hate to call the villa a “vacation home,” because it’s actually home in my eyes. Not some resort hotel.
68_Text=I hate to call the villa a “vacation home,” because it’s actually home in my eyes… Not some resort hotel.
19_Text=I have small yard sales sometimes. Trying to rehome the best of my collection. Interested?
193_Text=I haven’t spent a Winter here in so long.
5_Text=I just adore this island. They call themselves “islanders.” Oh, my heart! So adorbs.
26_Text=I know Mother would tell me to do whatever makes me happy. But I really don’t want to leave her alone, now that Father is gone.
199_Text=I learned to sail a long time ago, when I was <NPCName>Valentina</>'s age. Father sent me to a Summer camp where I also learned to scuba dive.
30_Text=I like to spend my Summers here, keeping up with my childhood friends. Surfing, staying up, chilling at the beach… What more is there to life?
13_Text=I love the mayor. He’s like a father to me. Always makes sure that I feel welcome here. Like, who do you know with a better heart?!
146_Text=I need to pack tomorrow. I’m bringing back some antiques and wine for Mother.
156_Text=I never really understood why, because honestly it was more tiring to me than anything. And I always had to wear some itchy dress… I hated those. But the parties, though… They were out of this world.
53_Text=I should host a dinner party and invite all my friends. Would you come?
75_Text=I should host a dinner party sometime and invite all my friends. Would you come?
184_Text=I suppose it doesn’t matter how far away I go. I always belong here…
187_Text=I suppose it may be a different era now.
109_Text=I tried going into the ocean the other day, and it was still too cold!//<portrait=concerned>Maybe I need to wait a few more days…
136_Text=I tried to get Mother to spend the Summer here with me. Just this one time, you know… I didn’t want to come alone. But she refused.
96_Text=I was born here, for crying out loud. But the thing is, Mother is from the other side of the globe. So I don’t know if I actually count as a Coral Island native.
111_Text=I wonder what <NPCName>Suki</> is up to? Frantically cleaning the inn, probably.
190_Text=I would invite you in, but the house still smells a bit musty.
8_Text=If you see anything you like at the villa, just let me know, darl. I can probably sell it to you.
18_Text=Is that impulsive? Maybe I should wait until Spring. I need to talk to Mother about it first, anyway… See what she thinks.
40_Text=Is that impulsive? Maybe I should wait until Spring… I need to talk to Mother about it first, anyway… See what she thinks.
7_Text=Isn’t that spectacular?!
175_Text=It was a really bad habit of his… Overworking himself. Then he would take me here for father-daughter time to make up for the time he spent working.
145_Text=It would be such fun to stay for Autumn! But I can’t… Ugh!
85_Text=It’s berry season! Oh, I would love to visit a berry farm this time of year.
126_Text=It’s getting cold, isn’t it?//<portrait=annoyed>Remind me again why I decided to move back here.
192_Text=It’s great to be back.
169_Text=It’s just a little bit of water.
144_Text=I’ll be here next Summer. Why wouldn’t I be? I would miss it too much.
151_Text=I’m afraid if I go to the forest alone, I might get lost and run into one of those monsters.
27_Text=I’m all she’s got. I feel bad, but I also don’t want to force her to move here with me.
33_Text=I’m gonna be at the beach all day tomorrow. Probably head to the tavern afterward. Will you be there?
44_Text=I’m heading to Dulca Island for Autumn. It’s the best time to visit, if you’re interested… Then I’m probably going to spend Winter with Mother.
10_Text=I’m heading to Dulca Island for the Autumn. It’s the best time to visit if you’re interested… Then I’m probably going to spend the Winter with Mother.
28_Text=I’m heading to Dulca Island for the Autumn. It’s the best time to visit, if you’re interested… Then I’m probably going to spend the Winter with Mother.
200_Text=I’m not a big diver, but it did add some heft to my college application.//It came in handy at cocktail parties… So I’m grateful.
134_Text=I’m not technically new here.//oh no no!//My family used to live in Coral Island until Mother decided to leave some time ago.
122_Text=I’m so <Italic>so</> sad Summer is over. Should I leave town again?//<portrait=happy>Just kidding! I think I’m gonna stay here for a while.
107_Text=I’m so excited for Summer, darl. It’ll be so much fun!//<portrait=surprised>The food, the swimming, the beach, everything!
106_Text=I’m so glad it’s starting to get warmer. I was this close to packing up and moving somewhere else!
133_Text=I’m so tempted to spend the Winter somewhere warmer.//<portrait=happy>Want to join me sometime?
115_Text=Just look around us, darl. You can see why I always come back here in Summer, can’t you?
66_Text=Let me tell you something… I feel like I’m being watched sometimes. There’s an extra pair of eyes in the villa. I can feel it.
77_Text=Living at the beach is hard to beat. Falling asleep with my windows open is simply the best.//The sound of the ocean is so relaxing.
191_Text=Maybe next time…
47_Text=Maybe next year. Start off with a clean slate, you know…
158_Text=Mother always insisted that we go skiing in the Winter, because you can do everything else any other time, according to her.//But skiing can only be done in the Winter.
3_Text=Mother is such a hoarder. I’m constantly finding new things around the house.
79_Text=My childhood friends are all here. This is where my parents had me. Mother planted flowers in this soil… And Father…
103_Text=My childhood friends are all here. This is where my parents raised me. Mother planted flowers in this soil. And Father…
91_Text=My childhood friends are all here. This is where my parents raised me. Mother planted flowers on this soil. And Father…
174_Text=My dad worked long hours at home, and there was a period when he didn’t come out of his office at all for days at a time.
76_Text=My oh my! Darling, you have to come. There will be plenty of food and good music. New friends! It will be so much fun.
54_Text=My oh my! Darling, you have to come. There will be plenty of food and music… New friends! It will be so much fun.
14_Text=No one, right?!
34_Text=No promises, though. If I get too exhausted, then I’ll just go straight home.
135_Text=Now I spend my Summers here, catching up with old friends…and making new ones along the way.
166_Text=Oh my! Was that thunder I just heard?
147_Text=Oh my! What a fun Summer! I just absolutely love it here.
31_Text=Oh my… I’m debating whether I should move back here this coming Winter, or next year.
46_Text=Oh my… I’m debating whether I should move back this coming Winter, or next year.
45_Text=Oh yes, of course. They call it Fall here, not Autumn, don’t they? It’s the falling leaves season.
112_Text=Oh, I need to tell you a funny story about <NPCName>Luke</>. One time, we were hunting for ghosts by that temple near the villa. It was dark, and I snuck away from him while he walked around the temple.//I hid, and when he noticed I was gone, he kept calling my name over and over again.//<portrait=surprised>So then, I jumped out and scared him! He fell down and he cried and cried and cried!
110_Text=Oh, darl, it’s finally, finally getting warmer. I can feel the Summer vibes just around the corner!
129_Text=Oh, darling, how do you stay so active in Winter? It’s so cold!
121_Text=Oh, do you happen to grow berries at your farm? I think Autumn is the perfect season for berry picking, don’t you?
194_Text=Oh, gosh, I hope the heat still works.
157_Text=Oh, how I miss the sound of waves in the Winter! I just spend the day curled up under a blanket.
59_Text=Oh, nothing compared to your farm, doll! A watermelon to a blueberry! My patch of land is as small as my villa.
168_Text=Oh, this rain isn’t going to stop me from leaving my house.
29_Text=Oh, yes, of course. They call it Fall here, not Autumn, don’t they? It’s the falling leaves season.
21_Text=Remember, I’m rooting for you! Keep it up.
137_Text=She prefers cold winds, she said. No use trying to talk Mother into anything. Fine by me…
159_Text=She’s not wrong, but it doesn’t make it right. I mean, every Winter, <PlayerName>$player</>? Skiing? Come on!
202_Text=So when you were in school, what did you do during your Summer breaks, if not sailing?
138_Text=So, tell me. What have you learned about farming so far?
105_Text=Spring cleaning is such a pain when you have a big house. It’s even worse when you have a mother who likes to buy so many things. Ugh.
52_Text=Sure, occasionally you get lonely, but sometimes it’s nice to just be by yourself, you know?
74_Text=Sure, occasionally you get lonely, but sometimes it’s nice to just be by yourself.
98_Text=Thankfully none of the people here ever made me feel like my appearance matters too much. Family gatherings, though… Whew! My cousins would let me have it.
118_Text=The Beach Cleanup Festival is the main reason I love Summer so much.
153_Text=The leaves are solid brown now. It’s a sign that the trees will start losing leaves soon.
161_Text=The one time I’m here, it rains.
164_Text=The one time that I’m here, it rains like this.
142_Text=The villa is too big for me to stay in. But I know Mother would be outraged if I swapped it for a modest-sized cabin.
154_Text=The weather definitely changed, but not enough to need a sweater.//I’m fine, thanks for asking.
6_Text=The wild jackfruit is so sweet here. If you’re lucky, you might find some massive ones near the river.
128_Text=There’s something really beautiful about the beach in Winter, isn’t there?
150_Text=This may sound a bit silly, but I’m curious about the forest. I heard there are monsters in the cavern?
170_Text=This place hasn’t changed. I love it.
25_Text=This place is the best in the Summer. Love, love, LOVE keeping up with my childhood friends. Surfing, staying up, chilling at the beach. What more is there to life?
196_Text=This stuff is unused and probably bored, sitting around with nobody paying attention to it.
182_Text=This volleyball court wasn’t here last year. I wonder if this was Pufferfish’s doing as well.
183_Text=Up for a game of volleyball?
201_Text=Wait, are you joking? You don’t know how to sail?
149_Text=We got just what we needed.
131_Text=We need to keep hydrated, always… Especially in Winter when it’s dry like this.
1_Text=Well, hello… Nice to meet you. Call me <NPCName>Nina</>.
139_Text=What a fun, simple life! I need to get me one of those. Oh, it’s just so tiring to always move from place to place, never feeling at home.
86_Text=What better way to spend the afternoon than toting around a basketful of berries and fresh flowers?
124_Text=What do you call it, darl, Autumn or Fall?
2_Text=What should I call you?
127_Text=What should I do today?//The cold weather makes me lazy.
119_Text=When I was younger, Father and Mother took me to the beach almost every single day in Summer.//Father would play with me in the water, and Mother would make banana fritters.//<portrait=happy>We always finished the day with some corn on the cob from the cart. It was so much fun!
116_Text=When I was younger, we didn’t always live here, but Father always made sure we came here for Summer. It’s his favorite place in the whole world.
177_Text=You come here to dance, don’t you? You look like the dancing type.
43_Text=You don’t look like a busy farmer, darling. Everything’s okay at the farm, I hope?
198_Text=You know how it is, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>. You’re all alone on that farm too. Or do you have company?
73_Text=You know, living alone is not as bad as I thought it would be.
162_Text=Your boots are soaked! It must be raining hard outside, huh?
181_Text=“Helena, she’s just a child… Just a plate, we still have plenty…” Blah blah blah.//A monster...I was.
83752B4F466642BA75255C92066A09F9=Durian tastes exactly how it smells for me. 
DD09160547F08E25695D2386E9C7A685=Prickly looking aside, it's simply the best part of Spring. 
283_Text=*humming*
193_Text=*mumbling* Oil, two loaves of bread…
206_Text=*shivers* I’ve got to get my shopping done fast. It’s too cold in here.//I can’t think.
107_Text=<NPCName>Alice</> thinks there’s intelligent life in the sky, but my money is on under the water.//<portrait=normal>Did you know we’ve explored less than 20 percent of the ocean?//<portrait=surprised>There’s gotta be merfolk or something living in the other 80 percent!
100_Text=<NPCName>Frank</> and I are getting ready for the Cherry Blossom Festival.//Mom and Dad used to help make the hot pot, but we took over, even before Dad passed away.
146_Text=<NPCName>Frank</> needs more help in Fall, so I usually work extra shifts on Sundays.
63_Text=<NpcName>Alice</> mentioned how weird it is that some flowers bloom at night.//Like, after the sun sets.//Don’t flowers need the sun to bloom?
176_Text=<NpcName>Alice</> prefers to stay active to keep warm, but not me.//I’d rather bundle myself up in bed.
84_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> and I can’t take the weekend off. That’s when the tavern is the busiest.
53_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> doesn’t mind working long hours.//He likes it.
55_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> is a good cook. But not much variety, you know?//<portrait=normal>He also has this tendency to substitute ingredients.
59_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> isn’t the oldest in the family.//<portrait=normal>We have an older sister who lives abroad… Four siblings, total.
68_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> was born in the summer, which is probably why he’s always energetic and upbeat…//<portrait=happy>Is that even a thing?
48_Text=<NpcName>Theo</> gets some quick money, and we get to advertise live music at the tavern.//<portrait=normal>People are drawn to live music for some reason.
110_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I saw something swimming in the distance the other day, and it was shimmering. It must have been a merfolk! Wait until I tell <NPCName>Alice</> about this.//Or it could’ve been <Italic>another</> seal, like that one time…
128_Text=A couple of very well-dressed people came here last year and started taking pictures. But they weren’t acting like tourists, you see.
45_Text=After working at Fishensips for a while, I think selling drinks is where the money’s at.//<portrait=angry>If it were up to me, the tavern would cut down on serving food and expand the drink menu.
200_Text=Ah, I can’t look down the cliff.
60_Text=Ah, wrong again. I’m also not the youngest in the family.//Our baby brother works at a start-up in a valley across the ocean.
43_Text=Ah… Sorry about that.
136_Text=Another exciting thing about Summer is that merfolk supposedly come out in the warmer weather…//<portrait=happy>Makes no sense whatsoever.//<portrait=normal>Also, impossible to prove.
137_Text=Are you excited for your first Summer here, <PlayerName>$player</>?
120_Text=Are you ready for the New Year’s Eve Festival? I know I am.//<portrait=happy>Yes, I know this is still the first week of Winter, but you can never prepare too early!
30_Text=Baking a cake is way more complicated than it looks.//For starters, it requires a lot of ingredients.
8_Text=Bam!//<portrait=normal>Your words, not mine.
46_Text=Besides, serving drinks is much easier than serving food.//It’s less messy, especially with big groups of people.
113_Text=But another story says that they’re where the fairies sleep.//I like the fairy story better, honestly.
210_Text=Do I believe them? That's another story... That would be a case-by-case basis.//<portrait=normal>I don't believe everything I read...//Most of them are just for fun.
92_Text=Do you think that’s good enough?
47_Text=Do you want to sign up for the live performance?//We only have <NpcName>Theo</> so far. I think he’s all right. People like his energy.
29_Text=Durian tastes exactly like it smells, to me.//<portrait=happy>Prickles aside, it’s simply the best part of Spring.
175_Text=Even if it’s just normal joint pain, why not get a professional opinion, right?
103_Text=Finally, it’s Summer!//Have you planned your Summer crops yet?
62_Text=Finding the right balance between working and taking time for yourself is important.//It helps you refocus on your goal.
74_Text=Gah. I miss <NpcName>Eddy</>.
141_Text=Get to know them, and they might share their knowledge with you.
187_Text=Good morning, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>You’re very early today. Running errands?
122_Text=Gotta say I’m not a big fan of the cold, but then again, who is, right?//Wait… Are you?
69_Text=Growing up with three siblings, every day felt like someone’s birthday at our house.
42_Text=Hard to talk about hiring more help with <NpcName>Frank</>.//He and I don’t see eye to eye.
199_Text=Have you been inside the lighthouse, <PlayerName>$player</>?
73_Text=Having three siblings taught me that there’s no such thing as personal space.
142_Text=Hmm… It feels incredibly humid today!//<portrait=annoyed>I hate the sticky feeling in Summer.//<portrait=concerned>The heat is nice sometimes, but when it’s this hot, just being outside can be tiring. Even if I’m doing nothing.
185_Text=Hmm… It feels incredibly humid today!//<portrait=annoyed>I hate the sticky feeling in the summer.//<portrait=concerned>The heat is nice sometimes, but in this heat, just being outside can be tiring. Even if I’m doing nothing.
98_Text=Honestly, at this point, I’m just counting down the days until Summer.
54_Text=I always say I’ll go to sleep early, but I end up watching TV until much too late.
183_Text=I bumped my head trying to clean the cabinet this morning.
181_Text=I can’t bear the thought of moving out and leaving my mom alone.
9_Text=I can’t wait for the dumpster to rebuild.
121_Text=I can’t wait to eat all the good food at the New Year’s Eve Festival.//The Duckorns, <NPCName>Luke’s</> family, usually have it catered by fancy Pokyo restaurants.//They had garlic ice cream a few years ago… It was weird but delicious.
36_Text=I don't have work today. The tavern is closed.//What’s up?
31_Text=I don’t have a lot of spare time to do things like cooking for fun.//It takes a lot to run a dining establishment.
151_Text=I don’t have a sweet tooth, so I think it’s just the cold weather getting to me. You know, having a bigger appetite and all.
168_Text=I don’t know if it’s safe to walk around in this weather.//<portrait=sad>What am I thinking?
118_Text=I don’t know why anyone would eat mushrooms raw. Ew.//<portrait=happy>Now roasted, that’s the way to go.
61_Text=I don’t mind doing the shopping.//That way <NpcName>Frank</> can focus on cooking.
86_Text=I don’t think we’ll lose customers if we just increase the price by 20 percent. But we’re too afraid to risk it, I guess.
90_Text=I grew up eating <NpcName>Frank</>’s experimental food, and that just might be why I’m a picky eater now.
64_Text=I guess not. Hmm…
94_Text=I had a lot of fun with her this week, walking around town and catching up.
18_Text=I have a feeling she’ll be gardening there 24-7.
123_Text=I have a video camera in my room that I usually leave on during Winter nights to record the sky.//One time, when I was about <NPCName>Archie’s</> age, I stayed up watching TV. It was pretty late, and I saw something flying in the sky – a sleigh.//I know, I know. But I know what I saw, so I’m trying to catch it on video.
157_Text=I haven’t complained once about how cold it is this Winter.//Go, me!
76_Text=I hope it won’t rain tomorrow. I need to visit the vineyard to pick up some wine…//<portrait=normal>The tavern is dangerously low.
160_Text=I hope there isn’t a leak in the community center.
180_Text=I hope you don’t mind if I stop by your place sometimes.
174_Text=I keep telling Mom to see <NpcName>Yuri</> for her hip pain, but she keeps ignoring it.//<portrait=concerned>She told me it’s just old age.
182_Text=I know she says she’s fine, but I don’t want to see her all alone in this big building.
19_Text=I like this town. It may not be Pokyo but it's home to me.//That is hard to beat.
88_Text=I lost a lot of sleep because of that, which inevitably affected my mood.
188_Text=I make a habit of checking the weather channel every morning before heading out.//You know, in case it might rain or something.
119_Text=I managed to find tons of mushrooms the other day! Now I just need to roast them all.//Not a big fan of cleaning them, though. It’s a lot of work.//The dirt just doesn’t seem to come off.
202_Text=I might grow my hair out after this.
203_Text=I might stay here a little longer to cool off.
108_Text=I need to tell Mom to wear her hat. She can’t be walking around in this Summer heat without one.//I’m worried she might get light-headed at the lake, and…//I don’t even wanna think about it.
144_Text=I picked up some coconuts from the beach the other day. They can be a quick hydration solution…//<portrait=surprised>Bah!//<portrait=blushing>That was a mouthful to say.
33_Text=I tend to do my errands before noon. Trying to get things out of the way.//That way I can work in peace.
117_Text=I think Fall is the best season for eating roasted mushrooms. It’s the best season for making them, too!//They’re sprouting in the wild. You can and hunt for them in the forest.
191_Text=I think I just caught one of my brother’s cats trying to sneak in here.
196_Text=I try to come here every Sunday to watch the sunset, when it’s not raining.
179_Text=I walked past your farm on my way to <NpcName>Ben</>’s the other day.//It looked so beautiful covered in snow.
106_Text=I was thinking maybe we could open a booth at one of the festivals, like the annual beach cleanup. Perfect, right?//We could sell cold drinks, homemade sweets… I don’t know. People swim; they get hungry. Simple logic to me.//But <NPCName>Frank</> won’t even give it a chance. Not enough staff.
51_Text=I work today. But only half a shift.
147_Text=If I don’t keep an eye on my mom, who will?
99_Text=If Mom can cook seasonal food, why can’t <NPCName>Frank</>? And why can’t we serve it at the tavern?//<portrait=normal>Now’s the perfect time for a seasonal menu.
124_Text=If it were warmer, I think I’d spend more time outside, but as it is?//<portrait=normal>I think I’ll just do the paperwork for the tavern.//Somebody’s gotta do the accounting, and it isn’t gonna be my big bro.
126_Text=If you have time, try some of our food and drinks. They’re the islanders’ favorites.
165_Text=Is it actually darker than usual outside, or am I losing my mind?
184_Text=It still hurts.
139_Text=It’s Summer, after all. Right?
201_Text=It’s giving me a headache…//My head is pounding.//Nope!
135_Text=It’s only the beginning of Spring, but I already can’t wait to spend my Summer soaking up some sun at the beach.
72_Text=It’s really not on purpose.//<portrait=sad>It’s just overwhelming to keep up with birthdays sometimes.
204_Text=It’s so hot outside.//I’m glad <NpcName>Sam</> has his air conditioner on full blast.
152_Text=It’s truffle season. I’m keeping an eye out in case I spot one in the wild.
192_Text=I’ll check on the cats later, before going to work.
189_Text=I’ll just have a small breakfast here, before my doctor’s appointment at noon.
3_Text=I’m convinced that something’s living in the dumpster next to the community center.
102_Text=I’m gathering all the ingredients for the hot pot.//<portrait=happy>Well, other than the ones the townsfolk are bringing, of course.
161_Text=I’m going to check on the library when the rain settles down.
95_Text=I’m looking forward to taking my mom to the beach next week.
4_Text=I’m not going to waste my time trying to convince you. I know what I saw.//<portrait=normal>Sometimes ago when I was walking home, I saw <Italic>something</> running really fast towards the dumpster.//And, get this! I asked around the next day, and <NpcName>Pablo</> said he heard the buzzing noise too.
91_Text=I’m not like my kitchen-warrior brother, <NpcName>Frank</>. I’m afraid I can only cook sunny-side up.
186_Text=I’m sorry if I complained too much.//<portrait=sad>I guess it’s just one of those days.
138_Text=I’m taking a bit of a break today, just trying to spend time outdoors.
39_Text=I’m turning in early today.
150_Text=I’ve been baking a lot more lately, but nothing’s turned out good… Bummer!
5_Text=Let me ask you, <PlayerName>$player</>. How can there be a buzzing noise in a place with no machines?
35_Text=Maybe it’s that “mixed punch” <NpcName>Frank</>’s serving.
154_Text=Mom and I used to spend my birthday hunting for truffles and winter vegetables in the forest. Then she would cook them up at night, as a side dish for ramen.
81_Text=My dad used to say: to test a marriage, you should either open a restaurant or have a bunch of kids.
27_Text=My favorite hiding spot used to be behind the Welcome sign.
32_Text=My mom has a reputation as the best baker around.//If you want to learn a few baking tricks, you should get to know her.
82_Text=My parents did both, and they survived! I know he was joking, but I think it’s accurate.
148_Text=My siblings all left the nest already. I’m all she’s got left.
194_Text=No matter how often you sweep the tavern’s balcony, it’s impossible to keep clean this time of year.//The leaves are constantly falling.
23_Text=No, not much has changed… Starlet has looked like this since I was little.//Every corner holds so many memories.
26_Text=Not much has changed here… Starlet has looked like this since I was a little boy. Every corner holds so many memories.
2_Text=Oh no, I didn’t mean it in a bad way.//I heard from the twins who run the inn that a new farmer moved in.//I just thought…you know…//Never mind.
205_Text=Oh, bees! Why is it so cold in here?!//<portrait=surprised>With the snow and all, you would think <NpcName>Sam</> would turn down the air conditioner a bit.
1_Text=Oh, hey! I have to say, you’re not what I expected.
25_Text=Oh, not from people! It was my hiding spot when I was playing hide-and-seek.
28_Text=Oh, not from people!//<portrait=normal>It was my hiding spot when I was playing hide-and-seek.
40_Text=Oh, nothing. I just have an early start tomorrow morning.
167_Text=Oh, um…be safe out there, <PlayerName>$player</>.//The storm is really bad today.
133_Text=Oh… Maybe we can have a potluck in Fall and Winter too…//<portrait=normal>Giving people a chance to bring their favorite dish for the community to enjoy makes the gathering more meaningful. It has that big-family feel.
71_Text=One of these days, I’m gonna miss somebody’s birthday…//<portrait=sad>I just know it.//<portrait=concerned>And THAT somebody will get upset because they remembered mine…//These social norms are just so hard to keep track of.
87_Text=One thing I don’t miss about Pokyo, though, is the constant blaring of car horns.
105_Text=Our air conditioner broke the other day… Thankfully, <NPCName>Pablo</> fixed it.//Some of the wiring was moldy, apparently. Good thing it wasn’t anything worse, like rats.
116_Text=Our family wasn’t as busy for the Harvest Festival… Yeah, we helped out.//But we pretty much hosted the Cherry Blossom Festival.
89_Text=Please don’t order the “mixed punch” – it’s mostly <NpcName>Frank</>’s failed experiment. Spare yourself a stomachache.
125_Text=Restocking supplies and doing paperwork is much better than being outside in the cold.
207_Text=Some people believe that creatures live in the deep forest...//Legend has it that they're imprisoned by the evil spirit somewhere and can't come back to their village.
34_Text=Something about being at the tavern makes some people share too much, too soon.//<portrait=sad>Hmm…
162_Text=Something warm sounds good right now.
109_Text=Sometimes <NPCName>Alice</> invites me to go to the forest to look for cryptids, but I’d rather search in the ocean or around the beach.
66_Text=Sometimes you don’t really know what you’re getting yourself into.
143_Text=Sorry if I’m complaining too much.//<portrait=sad>I guess it’s just one of those days.
67_Text=Strongest memory?//<portrait=normal>Hard to choose, but pranks might be some of the strongest ones…//<portrait=happy>Growing up with a lot of siblings means you learn a new prank every day – I can vouch for that!
114_Text=Such a bummer that Summer is over. But I guess it means I can focus more on the tavern.
149_Text=Taking a break from the farm, <PlayerName>$player</>?
115_Text=The beach is still pretty fun in Fall, but not as much as it is in Summer.
96_Text=The best memory with my mom?//Ah… Tricky question. I don’t know. I have too many good memories with my mom at the beach, it’s hard to pick just one.
7_Text=The blacksmith’s place is very close to the dumpster. Hmm…it could be the case.
50_Text=The more I read about UFOs, legends and myths...the more I think that we’re not alone in this world.
209_Text=The most interesting legends?Hmm... That's hard to pick.//The crying rock is interesting to me.
156_Text=The old one was fine. But <NPCName>Frank</> thought it was important to get a new heater in case the old one broke in the middle of Winter.
171_Text=The potatoes were to keep our hands warm.//Then we would eat them when we got to school.
85_Text=The tavern could charge a premium for drinks and meals, don’t you think? We use only the best ingredients.
166_Text=The tavern gets extra muddy when it rains.//<portrait=annoyed>People just don’t bother wiping their feet.
111_Text=The tide can get pretty high in Summer, but so far, it hasn’t ever reached the tavern.//Thank goodness, right? That sounds expensive to fix.
101_Text=The trees in Pokyo never looked this beautiful in the Spring.//<portrait=happy>I’m so glad I moved back here right after I graduated.
49_Text=The universe is so big, don’t you think? I think it’s a bit cocky to believe that all of this is only for us to enjoy.
158_Text=The weather is putting people in a good mood.
145_Text=The wind is getting colder. I think Fall is finally here.
97_Text=There are so many interesting Spring crops. I don’t understand why <NPCName>Frank</> won’t introduce a seasonal menu to take advantage.
127_Text=They also make great gifts.//It’s an easy way to win people over, you know?
129_Text=They mostly kept to themselves, and they each had a little yellow brooch on their jacket. I guess they were Pufferfish employees, surveying the area.
132_Text=They should at least consider having another potluck this Summer.
153_Text=They’re rare, though.
134_Text=Tomorrow is the first day of Summer.//<portrait=normal>Get ready, <PlayerName>$player</>. It’s going to get really hot around here.
41_Text=We could use more help running the tavern, but <NpcName>Frank</> is against it.//<portrait=concerned>He thinks that would be throwing money down the drain.
44_Text=We do our own grocery shopping and cooking.//<portrait=annoyed>It’s very time-consuming, if you ask me.
198_Text=We live in the middle of town. Ugh…//<portrait=normal>I wish the tavern were closer to the beach.//’m pretty sure that would bring in more sales for us, as well.
38_Text=We mainly buy supplies from <NpcName>Sam</>.//It’s our way of supporting other local businesses.
155_Text=We spent way too much money on a new heater for the tavern.
83_Text=Well, what else am I going to do on my day off?
65_Text=Well… Yeah, <NpcName>Frank</> is a good cook. But not much variety, you know?//<portrait=normal>He also has this tendency to substitute ingredients.
131_Text=We’ll be at the Cherry Blossom Festival on Wednesday. <NPCName>Frank</> will be grilling all day, so we should probably arrive a bit early to get things ready.
75_Text=When I was growing up, Mom and Dad assigned each of us a roommate.//<portrait=happy>I was with <NpcName>Frank</>, and my sister was stuck with our youngest brother, <NpcName>Eddy</>.
170_Text=When I was in elementary school, our sister would boil potatoes in the morning, to put in our coat pockets.
17_Text=When the mayor finally approves the building of a community garden, my mom will be ecstatic.
20_Text=Where else can we get white sand beach so close to a lake, huh?
6_Text=Who’s talking about me? I’M not talking about me.
70_Text=Why does it feel like it’s someone’s birthday every day?
104_Text=With the temperature rising, I think I’ll take Mom to Hillside for morning walks… Too much beach isn’t good for her.
208_Text=Yeah, I'm not sure!//<portrait=normal>I like reading up on legends and stuff, but I can't find many books on this. One book referred to them as Giants.//Tiny Giants, to be exact.
190_Text=Yeah, I’m okay, thanks for asking. //<portrait=normal>Just going for a general checkup.
37_Text=Yes, we’re open again tomorrow.
140_Text=You can learn a thing or two from your neighbors.//You might pick up a simple recipe to try out or even learn how to craft items for your farm.
197_Text=You can watch the sunset every day from your farm, yeah?//<portrait=happy>So lucky!
112_Text=You know, there’s a folk legend that says the daisy patches in Summer are places where they’ve buried a pure and innocent child who died.
159_Text=You must not have a lot of watering to do today, eh?
169_Text=Your cheeks are getting red. You need to warm up, <PlayerName>$player</>.
195_Text=Your farm is just over the creek, right?
167_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> says even after we finish school here, we have to go to school somewhere else and get a degree. What’s that?
207_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, I d-don’t really w-wanna t-talk right now. C-can we do it l-later?
119_Text=Are you looking for Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</>?
86_Text=Aww… Winter’s ending soon. I’m gonna miss the snow.
6_Text=Being a farmer is cool too. I hope you get to be on TV sometime.
63_Text=But even if I had land, I probably wouldn’t plant anything. I don’t like gardening.
31_Text=But for now, my job is to study hard and eat a lot of greens.//<portrait=normal>So I can grow big and strong someday.
21_Text=But sometimes, he plays volleyball with us… <NPCName>Rafael</>, his name is.//He’s not very good at it, but he’s a lot of fun!
186_Text=Can I still go surfing?
190_Text=Can you cook anything tasty with those veggies?
225_Text=Dad always makes a big deal out of me getting lots of fresh air. He says it’s good for kids like me.
5_Text=Dad and <NPCName>Jim</> used to chase monster fish!//<portrait=normal>And listen, listen… Dad was on TV a couple of times, being interviewed.//<portrait=happy>How cool is that?!
165_Text=Dad caught some really big fish a long time ago. He said he started fishing when he was my age.
160_Text=Dad got me a new action figure when he went into town the other day. It’s really cool.//See? The arms go up and down, and it says a bunch of stuff.
155_Text=Dad got me this really cool kite for my birthday. It looks like a big fish.//I like to fly it in the park when it’s windy.
222_Text=Dad has lots of books about fishing in here. I don’t really understand most of them.
127_Text=Dad keeps talking about something called the starboard of a boat.//Is that like the stars in the sky?
124_Text=Dad knows everything. He’s really smart.
96_Text=Dad said I have to go home right away after school.
55_Text=Dad said I’m a Pokyoite too.//<portrait=normal>He and Mom adopted me there and brought me here when I was a baby.
183_Text=Dad says Fall is salmon season. I hope <NPCName>Jim</> makes some more smoked salmon!
150_Text=Dad says I have to learn math if I want to be a detective, though. Guess I gotta keep working on it.
133_Text=Dad says I have to learn math if I want to be a detective, though.//<portrait=normal>Guess I gotta keep working on it.
59_Text=Dad says I need to take school seriously but also never miss playtime.//He says having hobbies is just as important.
182_Text=Dad says I should play with some kids from my class, but I don’t wanna.//<portrait=happy>I like to play alone sometimes.
177_Text=Dad says all the big fish come out in Summer. I wonder where they hide during Winter.
189_Text=Dad says farmers harvest a lot of crops in Fall. Did you harvest anything?
153_Text=Dad says he doesn’t need to pay for advertising with me around. But I don’t know what that means.
131_Text=Dad says his favorite day is Friday. He says mine might be Friday when I grow up, too.
144_Text=Dad says it’s not nice to wish for people to be murdered.
146_Text=Dad says we can go to the beach tomorrow since it’s a weekend. Yay!
32_Text=Dad told me I could be whatever I want if I put my heart in it.
91_Text=Dad won’t let me out. He said I’ll get sick if I play in the rain.
187_Text=Did you give your animals a hug today? You should make sure they’re happy.
110_Text=Dinner was so yummy! I’m stuffed… But maybe I can have another plate.
179_Text=Do they live in the ocean and come out just to buy ice cream?
125_Text=Do you ever eat fish for dinner, <PlayerName>$player</>?
52_Text=Do you fly kites, <PlayerName>$player</>?
134_Text=Do you have any animals on your farm, <PlayerName>$player</>? Can I come pet them sometime?
65_Text=Do you have one of those bee houses at your farm?
145_Text=Do you know anything about Pokyo?
89_Text=Do you still farm?
193_Text=Eating ice cream makes me feel even colder in Winter.//Brrrr!
24_Text=Errr… I can’t remember right now. I can tell you what we learned today, though.
112_Text=Eww… I just sat on something slimy! What is that?
147_Text=Got any ice cream, <PlayerName>$player</>? I’m starving!
200_Text=Guess I can’t play outside today.
139_Text=Have you ever had <NPCName>Jim</>’s smoked salmon? It’s really good!
136_Text=Have you ever solved a mystery? I bet it’s really fun.
175_Text=Have you seen anything strange on the island, <PlayerName>$player</>? Any mysteries to solve?
61_Text=He came to the school and introduced himself.//<portrait=doubt>He told us his name meant “the sun” in Indonesian.//<portrait=normal>Is he your friend?
184_Text=Hmm...was it Fall or Summer?//I can't remember.
108_Text=Hmm… Where’s the remote? Is it behind you?
202_Text=I always sleep better when it’s raining out.
231_Text=I am?! Thank you!//You're very kind, <PlayerName>$player</>.//That makes you very cool!
50_Text=I can’t wait for the weekend to play mini golf. It’s a fun game to play alone.
76_Text=I can’t wait to build a snowman with my friends!
137_Text=I can’t wait to solve mysteries when I grow up.

192_Text=I guess that’s because no one goes to the beach when it’s cold outside.
69_Text=I guess you’re a different kind of farmer, huh?
117_Text=I had a lot of fun.//Science helps you solve cases, you know! It's super cool.
141_Text=I have a big test tomorrow. Excuse me, <PlayerName>$player</>, but I have to get back to studying.

68_Text=I learned at school that farmers are usually working at their farms. But I see you around a lot!
95_Text=I like the rain. I’d just like it better if I got to play in it a bit longer.
9_Text=I really like all my friends here… They’re never mean to me.
169_Text=I stepped on a can at the beach the other day, and it made my foot bleed.//It really hurt, but Dad put a bandage on and it felt better.

219_Text=I wonder what fish think of snow. Do they even know it’s there?
154_Text=I wonder what we’re doing in school tomorrow. Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> always tells us about interesting stuff.
80_Text=Ice cream is the perfect treat. You can eat it in Spring...Fall like now, even Winter.//It's NEVER too cold for ice cream...or too hot! That's just silly.
223_Text=If you catch a fish, you should show it to my dad. He knows a lot about them.

30_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> said I’ll need to train in Pokyo to become a policeman because they don’t have the academy here.
98_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> told me if I missed a reading assignment again, I might have to stay after school for detention.
3_Text=My dad says if I promise to do my reading after dinner, I’m allowed to play at the beach after school…
56_Text=My favorite dinosaurs are velociraptors.//<portrait=happy>They’re the smartest kind, you know!//<portrait=doubt>Err… I’m pretty sure.

123_Text=My homework was really hard last night.//<portrait=doubt>I had to ask Dad for help.
1_Text=My name?// Hmm… My name’s <NPCName>Oliver</>. Why?
191_Text=No one comes to the Beach Shack when it’s cold outside.
176_Text=No? Oh, okay.
90_Text=Oh noooo! Can’t do anything today.
87_Text=Oh well! At least I get to see frogs soon!
15_Text=Oh! Or I might go to the park and play with <NPCName>Taco</>. If I’m lucky, I might get to play with <NPCName>Peanut</> and <NPCName>Butter</>, too.
28_Text=Oh, <NPCName>Taco</> the dog.//The one wearing a fancy scarf!
58_Text=Oh, don’t worry! We never found anything funny.//<portrait=normal>So you can rest peacefully.
100_Text=Oh, he said we all have to read the same book so we can talk about it as a group.
44_Text=Oh, um… Never <NPCName>Jim</>. He doesn’t laugh very much, actually.
113_Text=Oh, yikes… I don’t want to look.
198_Text=Rain, rain, go away! I wanna go out and play.
43_Text=Reading at the library is so much better than at home. Because sometimes Dad or <NPCName>Jim</> laughs so hard, the whole house shakes.
214_Text=SNOW DAY!
121_Text=School makes me really hungry.
118_Text=School must be very different from what you had back then.

39_Text=There must be a lot of bugs and worms at your farm, huh?
170_Text=There sure is a lot of garbage in the ocean. I wonder how it got there.
60_Text=There was a scientist who moved here last year.//<portrait=normal>He’s at the beach a lot… I think his name is <NPCName>Surya</>.
126_Text=There’s lots of fish around the island. I want to taste them all.
94_Text=They keep playing the same shows on TV lately… I think they ran out of ideas.
2_Text=Um, yeah! This is a normal day on the island, I guess.//Except now you’re here.
88_Text=Umm… Excuse me, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>, but what do you do all Winter?
111_Text=Umm… Maybe not. I don’t want my stomach to hurt.
20_Text=Usually, on Sundays, <NPCName>Valentina</> gets a visit from her uncle. So we can’t hang out too long.
10_Text=We get to look for bugs and dig worms together. Oh, don’t worry. We don’t take them with us.//Only look at them!
73_Text=We get to play at the beach the whole day, and win prizes.
102_Text=We learned about early civilizations… Errr… About how they lived and what tools they used back then.
64_Text=We learned flowers and bee houses can help increase the bee population.
57_Text=We used to play at your farm after school to try to see ghosts.//We wanted to see if it was haunted.
35_Text=Well, you’re rich now. You have a farm and all… Are you happy?
157_Text=Were you really good at school, <PlayerName>$player</>? I think Dad was.
33_Text=What did you want to be when you grew up?
226_Text=What does he mean? Is it not good for every kid?//Like, is fresh air bad for <NPCName>Valentina</> or something?
164_Text=What’s your favorite kind of ice cream? I really like mint.//It feels <Italic>windy</>in my mouth. You should try it!
27_Text=When I get bored on the weekend, I go to Hillside and play with <NPCName>Taco</>.//<portrait=normal>But only after I do my reading homework.
36_Text=Whoa! That sounds so cool!
34_Text=Whoa! Your dream came true!
180_Text=Why is it so hot? I hope Dad has some extra ice cream.
211_Text=Why is thunder so big and loud? It sounds like a giant foot stomping on Coral Island.
62_Text=Will you be planting any flowers this Spring? I can’t plant too much because we live on the beach. The sand won’t work.
106_Text=Wow! Look at yours! They’re like a giant’s.
4_Text=Yeah, I can watch TV… Of course.
208_Text=Yikes! Thunder!
77_Text=Yippee!
216_Text=You can’t really grow any plants when it’s like this, right? It would make them cold and sad.
38_Text=You have to be healthy and strong if you want to pass the police exam.//I’m eating my vegetables and protein, so I think I will be.
71_Text=You’re right! Every day is a good day to have ice cream!
79_Text=You’re right. Every day is a good day to have ice cream.//But Dad always says not too much of it, or I’ll get a stomachache.

87_Text=So what do you think of the Winter decorations, <PlayerName>$player</>? <NPCName>Rafael</> and I put them up every year.//They’re great, right? Makes the town more festive.
178_Text=So, <PlayerName>$player</>! What kind of music do you play to unwind, eh?
184_Text=Sometimes I come here to get away, but a guy like me rarely minds company.//<portrait=happy>Come on in!
140_Text=Still, you should probably stay put for a bit, warm up some.
93_Text=Talked to <NpcName>Randy</> about it, and he told me it isn’t easy to keep the education budget flowing.
177_Text=That sounds perfect! You’ve got the right idea.
65_Text=The Cherry Blossom Festival here is out of this world.//<portrait=happy>What’s better than getting together and eating good food?
101_Text=The annual beach cleanup will take place near the inn, at the beach, and I’m sure everyone will be there to help out.
90_Text=The drilling company?//<portrait=angry>Yeah… Everyone’s talking about it.
54_Text=The food is good, and the vibe is lively… What more do I want, right?
85_Text=The furnace can keep the whole house warm, all right…//We don’t need an additional heater.
108_Text=The last day of Fall is the busiest day for us.//That’s when <NPCName>Rafael</> and I put up Winter decorations around town. You know, so it looks more festive! Adds a little more color than plain white snow.
110_Text=The one at your farm is massive, so I’m sure you could plant some trees inside it too.
172_Text=The temperature outside only feels right to me in Summer.//Maybe because I’m always in front of a furnace?
73_Text=The trash collecting isn’t a contest per se, but…//<portrait=blushing>I like to think that it is.
68_Text=There’s always so much life in Spring. It makes me feel even more alive.
160_Text=This is a popular spot, eh?//<portrait=annoyed>I always see <NPCName>Anne</><cf> and <NPCName>Paul</> around here.
153_Text=Today, I told myself that I would just play a game of pool then go home, but I always manage to talk myself into staying longer.
98_Text=Ugh, today’s a busy day for me. I could use a cold drink right about now.
37_Text=We close early on Saturdays.//<portrait=normal>So if you need my help, better ask before noon.
9_Text=We develop a new weapon every now and then…//Well, basically whenever we have the time, to be honest with you.
141_Text=Well, I guess it is Winter. What else did I expect, besides getting snowed on?
134_Text=Well, I guess it is Winter.//<portrait=concerned>What else did I expect, besides getting snowed on?
2_Text=Well, it’s nice to finally meet you! Name’s <NPCName>Pablo</>.//I don’t know jack about farming, but hey!//<portrait=happy>If you need help with tools, come by my shop just north of town, and I’ll see what I can do. Ciao!
162_Text=What brought you to this side of the forest today, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>?
51_Text=When it comes to birthdays, I think people are just happy if you remember. It shows they’re on your mind.
152_Text=Why is it always in my left eye?//<portrait=happy>I guess it’s time for a new eye. Ha!
81_Text=Winter is such a bummer.//I can’t stand being outdoors in the cold too long.
126_Text=You here for business or just seeking shelter, <PlayerName>$player</>?
82_Text=You know what? Sometimes Winter isn’t so bad. At the very least, it makes working in front of the furnace so much better.//<portrait=sad>I’d still rather be outside, though…
45_Text=You look like you had a good day!
1_Text=You must be <PlayerName>$player</>, right?//<portrait=normal>Damn, I wasn’t expecting you to look like THIS.//You’re surprisingly cute!
55_Text=Your tools holding up all right, <PlayerName>$player</>?
80_Text=<NPCName>Zoe</> had a school project where we planted strawberries one time. It was fun.//We shared the harvest with some wild animals.
66_Text=<NPCName>Zoe</> is too young to go to the tavern. It’s very loud, and there’s alcohol and drunk people everywhere.//Just not ideal for kids.
142_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! Great to see you here, my friend.//Are you here to see some animal footage we got yesterday?
153_Text=A couple of <NPCName>Zoe</>’s friends live around here. She always has a lot of fun at the beach.
39_Text=Ah, <NPCName>Taco</>!//That’s the name. Yes.
97_Text=Ah, yes, yes! Heaters. I forgot the proper name for them for a split second there.//<portrait=normal>Must be my Winter brain coming back.
20_Text=Ah, your farm – something is going on over there, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=annoyed>Nothing spooky, but…
156_Text=And then the bear was behind me all along! That was scary. Very very scary... Forest can be scary at times.//But of course, I had to keep calm. <NPCName>Anne</> was with me... Don't want to spook the bear.//We stayed inside the tent the whole night.
55_Text=As long as you’re cool with it, of course.
65_Text=Besides, it’s probably healthier for her to eat at home, where we know where all the ingredients came from.//Though indulging every now and then can’t be too bad, can it?
67_Text=Besides, she has school tomorrow.//She won’t be able to wake up on time if she stays up late.
137_Text=But I’m here pretty much throughout the week, if that means anything to you.
62_Text=Cassowaries can be very dangerous if they feel threatened. I’m always very careful when I spot one.
70_Text=Cauliflower season, isn’t it? Yeah, I should know.//I used to be obsessed with growing it. My mom’s favorite vegetable.
149_Text=Come on, <NPCName>Zoe</>! Let’s see who the winners are!
155_Text=Did we talk? Really? Ah, must be the music then. It’s so loud; I can’t seem to focus. Apologies.
86_Text=Do you think we should plant more trees to shelter wildlife?
111_Text=Don’t let the rain stop you, <PlayerName>$player</>.
122_Text=Don’t let the snow stop you, <PlayerName>$player</>.
124_Text=Don’t let the snow stops you, <PlayerName>$player</>
115_Text=Don’t let the storm stop you, <PlayerName>$player</>.
42_Text=Don’t stay up too late, will ya? It happened to me one time, working late editing footage of a cassowary.//It didn’t end well.
121_Text=Either that or you really need um… Never mind.
114_Text=Good night!
128_Text=Great weather. Great weather, indeed.
118_Text=Great weather. Great weather, indeed. Keeping my hat on, though!
143_Text=HEY! <NPCName>Anne</>! We have a guest!
35_Text=Have you started farming this season?
92_Text=Hopefully, we can teach our kids to respect wildlife and to reserve some space only for them.
14_Text=Humph… I’ll just do it tomorrow.//<portrait=normal>I don’t think <NPCName>Anne</><lf>will notice.
40_Text=I can’t sit around at home for too long. I get bored easily and want to go make something of my day.
61_Text=I didn’t swim close to it. <NPCName>Anne</> and I were diving, and she happened to have a video camera on her. Lucky!
71_Text=I don’t like it that much anymore.
144_Text=I don’t see you here very often, <PlayerName>$player</>. I hope things are okay back at the farm.
135_Text=I don’t want to get too close to them. It’s their home. I don’t want to invade.
60_Text=I have footage of this massive green sawfish. I’ll have to show you sometime!
13_Text=I have to do the recycling today. I completely forgot about that.
147_Text=I haven’t had time to change them. We don’t get visitors often anyway.//Besides, wildlife doesn’t like a lot of light at night.
138_Text=I just finished editing last week’s footage. Everything is coming along great! Now onto the fun stuff.
87_Text=I knew you’d think so! Shelter isn’t just for rain, you know. It’s important on sunny days too. Just like us, animals don’t want to overheat.
141_Text=I know it’s technically a plant, but it’s rare, huh? People love to see it. We certainly do.
43_Text=I passed out and had to be taken to the hospital.
134_Text=I saw a couple of monkeys taking a bath in the lake the other day. It’s pretty hard to predict when they’ll be out.
38_Text=I saw that cute little puppy chasing birds in town yesterday.
28_Text=I think I’ll go down to the tavern tomorrow. It’ll be a great excuse to put my dancing shoes on.
74_Text=I was expecting to see way more frogs and bees this time of year.//Hmm…
145_Text=I was looking at a space back there to put a small pet house, maybe. Not for a pet, but shelter for wild animals.
31_Text=I wouldn’t mind editing some video, but <NPCName>Anne</> said it can wait.//So we’ll wait.
56_Text=It was <NPCName>Anne</>’s idea to make informative videos for kids, too… Made quite a bit from it, actually.//She thinks about stuff like that. She’s a very outside-the-box type.
79_Text=It was a rewarding project, and it taught kids the cycle of life firsthand.
81_Text=It was a rewarding project, and it teaches kids the cycle of life firsthand.
54_Text=It would be an exciting project to just camp out at your farm and see what wildlife we can find.
29_Text=It’ll be nice to see <NPCName>Frank</> too.
158_Text=It’s certainly one of a kind! Let’s dance to it!
22_Text=It’s only the beginning of the week, and we’ve already recorded some rare birds.
120_Text=It’s snowing outside, isn’t it?
72_Text=It’s still a bit chilly out, so I think some animals are still hibernating.
6_Text=It’s too close to town. So many people in one place scare off the wildlife.
140_Text=It’s tough to get footage of the corpse flower. The plant doesn’t flower often.
132_Text=I’m at the lake a lot. It's my job.//Gotta go where my job takes me. Seems like you are too, huh?
104_Text=I’m beginning to miss fresh strawberries. Hmm…
119_Text=I’m going to go out on a limb and say the animals are happy too today.//They like sunny days as much as we do.
30_Text=I’m having fun. I mean, it’s Saturday, and I’m spending time with the family!//<portrait=normal>What else are we gonna do today but have fun?
17_Text=I’m refreshed and ready to get back to work!
21_Text=I’m sure some unusual creatures live on that side of the island.//I don’t have any footage, though.
131_Text=I’m trying to capture footage… Will you keep your voice down, please?
151_Text=Keep your hat handy!
103_Text=Maybe <NPCName>Ben</> might have some… Hmm… Let’s hope so.
3_Text=Maybe I’ll plant cauliflower in our backyard. Hmm…
110_Text=My wife has been saying how humid it is lately. And I agree!
109_Text=My wife has been saying how humid it is lately. And I agree!//Even when it rains like this, eh?
98_Text=Oh my, it’s almost the twentieth.//I haven’t bought anything for my wedding anniversary yet.
154_Text=Oh, ho, ho, ho! <PlayerName>$player</>!
113_Text=Or maybe wait until tomorrow.//It’s getting pretty late.
53_Text=Phew. That was a heck of a surprise.
84_Text=Planting bananas around the lake may not be a bad idea. Wildlife could take advantage of them as well.
130_Text=Psst…
146_Text=Some of the bulbs on our porch burned out. Be careful going home, okay?
26_Text=Sometimes I wait for weeks and don’t get any usable footage at all.
148_Text=Sweating the day away, <PlayerName>$player</>? I’m playing volleyball with the family.//<portrait=happy>Trying to see see if I can still beat my wife at it.
88_Text=Thankfully, most of the trees here are renewables.//And the fact that we plant more trees every year has really helped the environment.
129_Text=That’s why I’m out here, <PlayerName>$player</>. Why else?
2_Text=The docuseries Friends with Wildlife? Yeah!//<portrait=normal>My wife and I made that! I can’t believe you know about it.//Cool, cool! Very cool.
85_Text=The thing about planting in the wild is so much wildlife comes out at night.//The seedlings would probably be gone the next day.
15_Text=The town seems much cleaner lately, for some reason.//Have you noticed that?
5_Text=There are rats and snakes around the dumpster, but I don’t think other wild animals go near it.
91_Text=There’s a certain part of this island we don’t touch at all, and I’m glad for the restriction.
9_Text=Think you could give me some gardening tips? Let’s say I want to plant some carrots…
23_Text=This is my week.//This week is going to be a doozy, I can tell!
25_Text=This may come as a surprise, but making a wildlife documentary is mostly just waiting around.//Not a lot of action… The narration, though. That’s a different beast altogether.
24_Text=Try not to spook the wildlife when you go in the forest, will ya?
77_Text=Try not to step on them!
136_Text=Uh… I don’t know who comes here on weekends. I usually spend mine at the beach.
75_Text=Watch your step, <PlayerName>$player</>. As the weather gets warmer, more animals will come out of hibernation.
76_Text=Watch your step, <PlayerName>$player</>. As the weather gets warmer, you may find snakes in the forest.
152_Text=We get to see seals and all kinds of fish here. Sometimes turtles come to the shore, but not very often.//So keep an eye out.
68_Text=We made some videos for <NPCName>Zoe</> when she was younger, to teach her about wildlife.//We weren’t thinking then that other kids would like them, too!
78_Text=We planted strawberries one time for <NPCName>Zoe</>’s school project. It was fun.//We shared the harvest with some wild animals.
69_Text=Well, <NPCName>Anne</> did, actually.//<portrait=normal>Then we sold a few, and they were surprisingly successful, so we made more. But now that <NPCName>Zoe</>’s a bit older, we kind of stopped making them.
41_Text=Well, not just at home… I don’t like being confined in general.//<portrait=normal>It scrambles my brain.
139_Text=Well, yeah. My wife does most of the editing. She likes it.
105_Text=We’ve been enjoying building snowmen this Winter. I think <NPCName>Zoe</> had a lot of fun.
27_Text=What a day, eh?
16_Text=What a weekend! I was glad for a break, but… Phew! I’m glad it’s over.//<portrait=normal>I love dancing, but my hips weren’t made for dancing, I can tell you that much.
117_Text=What are we doing indoor? We should be out there in nature. In the rain!
108_Text=What are we doing indoors? We should be out there in nature. In the rain!
133_Text=What are you doing here this time of day, anyway?
34_Text=What are you up to this week? You always seem to be busy and running around all the time.//What a life you must have, eh?
8_Text=What have you got up your sleeve? Come on, don’t be shy.
157_Text=What in the world is this song? Do you think <NPCName>Theo</> wrote it himself?
52_Text=Whoa! <PlayerName>$player</>!
93_Text=Winter, eh? Less work for me and you. There are significantly fewer animals out and about this time of year.
63_Text=Yeah, it’s the same way with a lot of animals.//They’re beautiful creatures, and we have to be careful not to harm them. They have feelings, too.
57_Text=Yeah, the videos are about wildlife, of course. We made them easy for kids to understand.
150_Text=You can always dive into the ocean if it gets too hot.//Cool down a bit, eh? Don’t overheat!
99_Text=You don’t know where to get sunflowers this time of year, do you? They’re <NPCName>Anne</>’s favorite.
125_Text=You wanna go and mine? You go and mine, fella!//<portrait=normal>The island is your oyster.
96_Text=Your animals are okay, I hope? It can get really cold in the barn.//I’d get one of those warmer machines if I were you.
1_Text=You’re going to be a farmer, huh?//<portrait=annoyed>What brings you out here, then?//<portrait=normal>By the way, you can call me <NPCName>Paul</>.
4_Text=You’ve seen our backyard, right?//Is the environment too harsh for cauliflower, you think?
21_Text=*<NPCName>Peanut</> doesn't seem like a big fan of Winter.*
19_Text=*<NPCName>Peanut</> doesn't seem to enjoy the storm.*
7_Text=*<NPCName>Peanut</> looks adorable today.*
14_Text=*<NPCName>Peanut</> seems cheerful today.*
6_Text=*<NPCName>Peanut</> seems happy today.*
12_Text=*Adorable kitty!*
3_Text=*This cat is so adorable."
11_Text=*Whoa... <NPCName>Peanut</> is so fluffy today.*
10_Text=*You wonder what the cat is doing there but realize that maybe that's just what cats do.*
108_Text=Have you heard about our game? You should visit me sometime.
190_Text=*yawns*
67_Text=<NPCName>Joko</> and <NPCName>Dinda</> are top-notch carpenters, anyway.//I don’t think the market here is big enough for another carpenter, even if I wanted to be one.
227_Text=<NPCName>Pablo</> and I went over to the inn and had a quick dinner with our niece, <NPCName>Valentina</>, to celebrate her birthday last week.
228_Text=<NPCName>Pablo</> gave her a geode because he thought she would enjoy finding treasures, but I guess not…
98_Text=<NPCName>Pablo</> is my older brother.//We look a bit alike, don’t we?
130_Text=<NPCName>Pablo</> keeps inviting me to the tavern, but I keep telling him I just want to be inside.//<portrait=sad>It’s too hot to do anything… I don’t like it.
39_Text=<NPCName>Pablo</> spends a lot of time in the garage. He seems to ALWAYS be calibrating his TV.
212_Text=<NPCName>Taco</> lived here for several weeks.//Then <NPCName>Suki</> brought him over to <NPCName>Luke</>’s for a playdate, and the puppy refused to come back.
135_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> can play in the sun the whole day – in this heat.//I don’t know… I don’t think it’s healthy, right?/ What do you think?
73_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> is a great kid. I feel like <NPCName>Antonio</> is a bit too hard on her sometimes.//But I’m not a parent, so…
193_Text=A storm like this blew our roof off one time.//<portrait=sad>We had to relocate for a few days while it was being fixed.
84_Text=According to legend, the Ironeye Hammer also speaks to you while it works!//<portrait=happy>I wonder if it knows any jokes.
25_Text=And some compensation for our labor would be nice.
177_Text=And…my stomach hurts thinking about it.
49_Text=Another customer? Coming out of the woodwork these days, aren’t ya?
125_Text=Are you busy, <PlayerName>$player</>? I hear farmers are usually really busy in Spring.//Do you need help?//<portrait=concerned>I don’t think I can help, though. I’m a little busy myself. Sorry…
147_Text=Are you warm? Make sure to stay warm, okay?
68_Text=Argh.//<portrait=surprised>Oh, hey! Didn’t see you there.
52_Text=Aside from <NPCName>Pablo</>, of course.//He’s great.
48_Text=Business is booming. We need more space.//Or better tools.
204_Text=Calling it a day and going to rest. I’ll continue tomorrow.
89_Text=Do you think the explorer found the tevandium yet?
86_Text=Does it get tired? Does it take personal days?//<portrait=surprised>The legends are mysteriously silent on these issues.
35_Text=Don’t be alarmed. It’s completely normal.
205_Text=Don’t slip going home.
171_Text=Dulca Island is very far from here.//<portrait=normal>Growing up, our parents used to take <NPCName>Pablo</> and me there to see our grandparents. But, you know, not too often.
159_Text=Eating something cold like cold fish or ice cream would be good right about now.
173_Text=Ever since you moved here, <NPCName>Sam</> has much more variety in his store.
142_Text=Fall has to be my favorite season.//I’m lucky to live here. It’s easy to go out and enjoy nature whenever I want to.
31_Text=Favorite sushi? Umm… I like sushi in general.//So, as long as it’s fresh, any kind is fine by me.
155_Text=For some reason mosquitos don’t bite me. Isn’t that weird?
218_Text=Getting the right weapon can really help with slaying certain monsters.
139_Text=Gonna spend the weekend nights watching Fall films with ghosts…//Even better, ghosts from folk tales. What are you gonna do?
82_Text=Have you ever heard of the Ironeye Hammer? Legend says it’s a magic hammer that forges items by itself!
56_Text=Have you heard the legends about magic on this island?//<portrait=annoyed>Bunch of silly hand-waving and mumbling, if you ask me.
162_Text=Heh heh… What? You look happy today.//It kind of makes me happy to see.
65_Text=Hillside is a great spot to live in. Just far enough from the town.//Unlike the woodlands… That’s a tad too close to everyone.//<portrait=annoyed>Whatever, though.
57_Text=Hopefully I’m wrong… ’Cause that would be really cool.
176_Text=Hot air balloon rides terrify me…but I would like to try someday.
132_Text=How’s your Summer so far? Mine’s okay. I spend a lot of nights watching horror films in my room.//No, no. I don’t have a TV in my room. I have this tablet… Anyway, never mind. It’s small and not very fancy.
108_Text=I also help out at the inn, doing odd jobs. Changing light bulbs and all that. The twins never asked me to do anything… They don’t need my help, but I don’t mind doing it.
156_Text=I brought some edamame for <NPCName>Valentina</> yesterday. I keep forgetting that she hates it.//I hope she doesn’t hate me now.
133_Text=I can hear the bugs singing at night outside my window.//Yeah, it’s nice.
104_Text=I can’t believe people throw out perfectly good food around here.//What a waste.
83_Text=I don’t believe in it, of course. But imagine how much time I’d save if it were true…
8_Text=I don’t mind cleaning up the town. I grew up here.//This whole town is my playground, and I want to take care of it.//I would appreciate it if you can also keep it clean.
214_Text=I don’t take orders outside of the shop.//If you want to get your tools upgraded, come by to the shop tomorrow, will you?
224_Text=I don’t usually come here, but it’s <NPCName>Pablo</>’s birthday today, so I just came out for a celebratory meal.
188_Text=I feel awkward talking here.
136_Text=I feel like the grass right now. Withered, yellow, lifeless…//Maybe I should drink some water.
145_Text=I forgot to close my bedroom windows the other day before going to work…and my bed froze.//Well, yeah… No, it wasn’t actually frozen. It was just really cold.//<portrait=sad>Um…sorry.
30_Text=I get it, though. It’s hard to get peace and quiet when you work next to a massive furnace all day.
97_Text=I hate to be pessimistic, but I’m starting to doubt the explorer is going to return with that tevandium, <PlayerName>$player</>.
19_Text=I have all these ideas for weapons, but I can’t make them just yet.//<portrait=concerned>Our current furnace isn’t up to it.
168_Text=I hope <NPCName>Stephen</>’s claw grows back real soon so he can go back to exploring the sea.
184_Text=I hope it starts raining soon.
91_Text=I hope it’s real. I have big plans.
127_Text=I just want to stay outside all day…//I need some fresh air.
111_Text=I know what happened, <PlayerName>$player</>. I figured it out. I sent that explorer to his doom!
75_Text=I like creating weapons more than upgrading tools.//We have limited resources for making weapons, but that won’t stop me from going all out.
41_Text=I like peace and quiet.//<portrait=surprised>Oh, you too? Well, we’re kind of the same, then. Is that why you moved into your grandparents' farm?
174_Text=I like the cold wind. It feels good against my face after a whole day exposed to the hot furnace.
58_Text=I love creating weapons. One day I hope to make something truly special.//Something people will remember me for.
220_Text=I need to go back to work.
161_Text=I need to go to the clinic this week… For personal business.
225_Text=I never notice how loud it is in here. Wow!
128_Text=I rented this horror film yesterday… <Italic>Alakazam</> – a classic, I think. I watch it every Summer.//<portrait=annoyed>Anyway… I haven’t had a chance to watch it. I think I’m gonna need to pay late fees again.*sighs*
226_Text=I should go home soon. I feel exhausted.
9_Text=I should start gardening. I’ve been relying too much on nature lately.//I’ve only been gathering mushrooms, and I’m getting tired of those things…
105_Text=I smelt ores all day sometimes. *sighs* So please don’t mind my dirty clothes.
43_Text=I still have some work to do for the day so I can't go to the Inn today.//I usually visit my niece at the inn on Sunday. I get to see the twins too.
199_Text=I tend to spend too much on things I don’t need at the fair.
144_Text=I think I have the ingredients to make ramen tonight.//Gonna eat it in my room and watch funny videos on my tablet.
66_Text=I tried carpentry, but it’s not for me.//I can make small things or fix a cabinet, but building a whole house is too much.
51_Text=I use my forge, my bellows, and my own two hands.//Sometimes, though, I wish I had a little extra help.
53_Text=I wish I could spend more time with my niece, <NPCName>Valentina</>.//My work here keeps me so busy, though.
126_Text=I wish Winter could be longer, but new horror films are usually released in Fall… So, that’s something to look forward to with the new year.
90_Text=I wonder if it’s real. Tevandium, I mean.//The explorer said he’d seen it, but if it’s mythical, who knows what he really saw?
141_Text=I wonder what Beluga Bay will be showing at this year’s Harvest Festival…
138_Text=I wonder what films are coming out this Fall.//I like the ones with jump scares. Just nice classic horror films with ghosts.//<portrait=concerned>Um…
92_Text=I would have expected the explorer to be back with the tevandium by now. I hope he’s okay.
157_Text=I would probably fish if I didn’t have to keep my parents’ shop open.
119_Text=If I can’t remove them, I’m wondering if I can just go ahead and make the Ironeye Hammer anyway.
146_Text=If I get too hot, I just step outside and let the Winter air cool me down.//I can do that now…because it’s Winter.
219_Text=In my downtime, I sometimes mine for some ores in the cavern to make weapons.//You can always count on our store if you need ores right away.
120_Text=Is it hot outside, or is it just me?
223_Text=It feels good to be outside every once in a while.//<portrait=normal>The shop is way too hot sometimes.
40_Text=It sounds good to have a big empty place in the middle of nowhere, to be honest.
211_Text=It was probably <NPCName>Alice</>’s.//<portrait=normal>That girl is out of this world with her theories.
198_Text=It’s a bit harder to walk when it’s raining, though.
88_Text=It’s been a couple days since my explorer friend left to find tevandium. I can’t wait until he comes back!
106_Text=It’s easy to lose track of time. Smelting ores is such a mundane job.//My body immediately goes into autopilot.
140_Text=It’s still too warm to spend all day in front of the furnace.//<portrait=normal>But at least the wind is pretty cool.
196_Text=It’s storming outside.
85_Text=I’d be a fool to put my trust in the Ironeye Hammer.//It works by itself, but the legends don’t say whether it’s a good worker.
87_Text=I’d best get back to work. My head’s been in the clouds too much these days.
179_Text=I’m afraid I might say the wrong thing and ruin people’s dinners.
151_Text=I’m bringing some fish to the potluck. I’m not a big fan of vegetables.
178_Text=I’m feeling a bit nervous about <NPCName>Bree</>’s dinner party tomorrow.
124_Text=I’m glad the birds are out and about, but sometimes I wish they’d pipe down a bit. Just a bit.
222_Text=I’m going back to work after this.
208_Text=I’m just cleaning up a bit of moss on the stones.
137_Text=I’m looking forward to <NPCName>Betty’s</> homemade mooncakes. They’re always the highlight of Fall for me.
122_Text=I’m looking forward to the hot pot at the Cherry Blossom Festival.//<portrait=annoyed>Not looking forward to fishing the vegetables out of my portion, though…
166_Text=I’m not doing anything special today. It’s just another Thursday for me. What about you?
118_Text=I’m still having a hard time removing the impurities from the tevandium.
114_Text=I’m sure that explorer will be back with my tevandium any day now.
194_Text=I’m sure your cabin would be fine, though. Don’t worry.
107_Text=I’m visiting my niece tomorrow. It’s good timing to go and visit the beach, isn’t it?
79_Text=Legend has it you can make some really incredible stuff, with the right ore.
134_Text=Maybe I can install some ceiling fans in time for next Summer.//<portrait=annoyed>All I do is fan myself in bed using old newspapers… Makes me feel like a salmon being smoked.
45_Text=Maybe I can live there full time and walk to work.//<portrait=surprised>But it would be a waste of money.
116_Text=Maybe I need a vacation. Get away from the forge for a bit.
96_Text=Maybe I shouldn’t have paid half up front.
24_Text=My brother and I can upgrade all kinds of tools.//You just need to bring us the ores.
2_Text=My name is <NPCName>Rafael</>.//<portrait=concerned>Umm...//<portrait=normal>I’m one of the blacksmiths here in Starlet Town.
170_Text=My parents aren’t natives of Coral Island.//They came here when they were young, with two of my uncles, from Dulca Island.
54_Text=My work keeps me so busy. I wish…
23_Text=No, I don’t really go to the Tavern.//I go to the lake sometimes if I need to relax.
99_Text=No, just us. We don’t have any other siblings.
55_Text=No. No wishing. You want something?//You work for it.
191_Text=Oh no! I need to dry off my boots. Mud everywhere!
38_Text=Oh no, I haven’t had the time to visit the cemetery.//<portrait=normal>Maybe next Monday.
192_Text=Oh well.
175_Text=Oh! Umm… <NPCName>Stephen</> is <NPCName>Macy</>’s adopted lobster.
16_Text=Oh, it’s not bad or anything, but I wouldn’t mind an upgrade, you know.
221_Text=Oh, umm… I came here for some tacos.//I’m not in the mood to cook anything.
1_Text=Oh… Hi there...
37_Text=Okay, maybe trying out a new weapon.//<portrait=happy>That stuff is creepy too.
20_Text=Once we upgrade the furnace, hopefully we can make more advanced weapons and tools.
71_Text=Open pretty much every day, but the store closes early tomorrow.//<portrait=happy>And we’re closed on Sundays.
15_Text=Our shop has been the same since Mom and Dad retired.
117_Text=Purifying the tevandium will be hard, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m not even sure I can do it. But I have to try!
81_Text=Right…right! Tourists.//Some of ’em have some pretty wild stories…
74_Text=She’s the daughter of my cousin, <NPCName>Antonio</>.//Yeah, she calls me and <NPCName>Pablo</> “uncle,” even though we’re not her dad’s actual brothers. It’s kind of a thing in our family… I don’t know.//It’s not weird at all for me…
213_Text=So <NPCName>Taco</> lives there now.
210_Text=Some of the books here are very odd.//<portrait=annoyed>I think I read something about a flying dog one time.
6_Text=Some people. *sighs*
42_Text=Something in common, eh?
209_Text=Sometimes I come here to read a book. It’s nice and quiet.//<portrait=normal>What are you doing here?
131_Text=Sorry I’m such a bummer, <PlayerName>$player</>. I think it’s just a Summer thing… I hope.
78_Text=Sorry, I’m a bit busy. I need to fix this real quick.
60_Text=Still, stories have to start from somewhere, right? Maybe there’s a mote of truth in ’em.
121_Text=Summer is a little uncomfortable for me. I prefer Winter.//<portrait=concerned>Uh…um…maybe Fall.
158_Text=That would be a very different life for me. I would get a lot of fresh air.
112_Text=That’s the only explanation for why he hasn’t come back. What a fool I’ve been!
94_Text=The Greatstone Amulet, the Firestarter’s Axe…this could change the entire shop.//<portrait=happy>The entire island!
93_Text=The Ironeye Hammer isn’t the only tool you can make with tevandium. Just the most famous.//<portrait=happy>I can’t help but let my mind wander.
44_Text=The air is different at the beach. It’s saltier.//<portrait=annoyed>And a bit sticky.
185_Text=The bushes need some water.
183_Text=The cemetery is starting to smell. It could use a rinse.
27_Text=The cemetery is very quiet… So is the lake.//It’s my ideal place to read horror novels.
123_Text=The cherry blossoms are really pretty this year.
160_Text=The majority of the trash here drifted in from the sea. Can you imagine what it’s like where this trash came from?
197_Text=The rain is relaxing, isn’t it?
189_Text=The rain makes for some relaxing white noise in the background, don’t you think?
202_Text=The snow helps me build up a resistance to cold weather.
181_Text=The walking path could stand to be rinsed off.
80_Text=There are a lot of explorers coming to town these days.//A few come into the shop, looking for weapons or tools. Just like you.
76_Text=There are weapons that I’ve made...weapons that I can’t sell, because they failed the safety test.//<portrait=happy>But maybe I can show them to you sometime.
5_Text=There is so much trash around this island.//I go to the river? Trash.//I visit my niece at the beach? Trash.
59_Text=There’s more ore than what you find down in the cavern. Incredible stuff.//Some might say mythical…//<portrait=annoyed>Course, most of that is probably just old stories.
36_Text=There’s nothing I like more than a good horror movie.//It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
115_Text=These days I feel like I’ve lost my wits. I need to get my head out of the clouds.
200_Text=They make a stop here every year before going down south.
148_Text=This Winter is a little dry.//My hands hurt if I wash them too much. But it’s nothing unbearable.//It’s okay…
163_Text=Today is the last day of Summer, yet the heat doesn’t want to let up.
21_Text=Uhh…? What’s wrong?
22_Text=Umm… After work, I usually just cook dinner or something. I don’t know…//<portrait=sad>Did that answer your question?
152_Text=Umm… I meant the Cherry Blossom Festival.
217_Text=Upgrading a tool, <PlayerName>$player</>?
7_Text=We get a lot of work from the town.//Putting up decorations and stuff.
33_Text=We get our ores from the cavern… The one located up north of the forest.//If you don’t see the ores you need, I suggest you keep digging.
206_Text=We have some snow boots at the shop.
26_Text=We only accept money as a form of payment. Sorry.
72_Text=We’ll keep working nonstop if we don’t keep a schedule. Not good…
46_Text=We’re closed today. The store also closes early on Saturdays.//Family day for us.
95_Text=What if the explorer decided to keep all the tevandium for himself?//I just realized that he never told me where the cave was, exactly…
216_Text=When <NPCName>Pablo</> tells jokes, my parents laugh harder, you know… Simple stuff like that.//<portrait=concerned>People don’t notice, but I do.
34_Text=When you upgrade your tools, they’ll change color slightly.//It depends on the upgrade material.
149_Text=Winter coats are hard to wash.//They’re very thick. They take a long time to dry.
172_Text=Winter is a great time to upgrade your tools. That way you can be prepared for a busy Spring.
143_Text=Winter is nice… I like it.
129_Text=Working in front of the furnace in Summer is something else… //I can tolerate it just fine in other seasons, but Summer is just unbearable.
201_Text=Yeah, he’s part of it. But I think <NPCName>Ben</> stays here, in Coral Island.//<portrait=normal>Only travels once a year.
103_Text=Yeah, sure, I can see myself as a farmer.//Didn’t we talk about this already?
77_Text=Yeah?
207_Text=Yeah? Is something the matter?
28_Text=Yes, I read other books too.
70_Text=Yes, sometimes <NPCName>Pablo</> does, too.
153_Text=Yes?
215_Text=You can always tell when my brother walks into a room.//Any room, really… Conversations seem to get livelier, don’t they?
69_Text=You can check out our shop if you need some new weapons or boots.//I make most of them myself.
203_Text=You can find all sorts of minerals in the cavern.//If you dig deep enough, there are plenty of diamonds and such. Beware of monstrous bugs, okay?
47_Text=You can sell metal bars, and they go for more than raw ores.
154_Text=You can turn canola into oil using an oil maker.//I don’t think you can buy oil makers, but you can easily make one yourself once you have the blueprint.
32_Text=You fish a lot, don’t you? You must eat a lot of fish.
102_Text=You know, my parents were once farmers just like you. They said that you need to be strong to be one.//Kudos to you.
113_Text=You want something done, do it yourself.//I should have just paid him to tell me the location of the ore, instead of making him get it for me.
7_Text=Any of our posters isn't for sale.//If you're interested to purchase, I can pass on the interest and we'll get back to you if anything changes.
4_Text=Are you looking for something in particular?
1_Text=Good day, how may I help you?
3_Text=I've seen all the wonderful things Pufferfish have done for their communities. I believe you can see the results of those actions in the meeting room behind me.
5_Text=Over to my right is our employee's working area. Behind me is the manager's office, right now occupied by our branch manager, Karen.
2_Text=Please don't hesitate to ask for my assistance whenever you are within the Coral Island branch of Pufferfish Corporation.
6_Text=We have a meeting area with some of our past projects' results on display. Feel free to look around!
28_Text=Being outdoors has its downside on days like this…
14_Text=Coffee beans from different regions taste different. Things like soil and weather make an impact.//Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think you can grow <Italic>good</> coffee beans right now, right? In Spring?
25_Text=Every once in a while, I create a coffee omakase, usually in Fall.//I taste test my favorite combos of the year before putting it on the menu.
26_Text=For Fall, you just gotta go with the classic cocoa and caramel notes in your coffee. It’s perfect for this season.
12_Text=For Spring, I usually go for a coffee with floral notes. It seems fitting for the season.
27_Text=Have you ever tried cooking with dragon fruit, friend? It looks so dramatic, doesn’t it?//<portrait=annoyed>I’ve been trying to come up with a recipe using them, but I haven’t come up with anything good.
23_Text=Have you seen the daisies? I’m so tempted to put them in my beard!
1_Text=Hello! I don’t think I’ve seen you before. Are you new in town?
6_Text=I can’t stand when people wear perfume that’s too strong…//It overwhelms my nose for the day, and I don’t like that.//I like to be able to smell the coffee.
20_Text=I don’t drink coffee every day. Yeah…no.//I do enjoy the many different flavors each cup offers. Always a great experience… A mood booster.
31_Text=I don’t wear perfume or any strongly scented things… especially when I’m making coffee or blending beans.//Those scents can compromise the coffee beans.
22_Text=I pay attention to my customers when it comes to their preferred coffee time, and of course, their favorite blend.// For instance, the astrophysicist, <NPCName>Wakuu</>, likes his coffee in the afternoon, and <NPCName>Aaliyah</> likes it early in the morning.//Yeah, she’s the military pilot. Was or is – not sure.
19_Text=I prefer to brew locally grown beans, of course…but yeah, no. There isn’t much choice, unfortunately.//We can only plant coffee beans here in Summer. So that means I have to import some of my beans.
21_Text=I think Summer is perfect for coffee with citrus notes. Doesn’t Summer feel like a citrusy season to you?
5_Text=I’m not too worried about how much the coffee shop makes. Creating the perfect cup of coffee is where my mind is.//Each individual cup… Yeah, each of them is special.
33_Text=Living at the inn is great…especially in Winter. It’s cold out, and you just wanna chill with friends.//Yeah, the inn is cold and the heater is…questionable at times, but the residents are friendly.
10_Text=My hair gets sticky fast in Summer. Kinda hate it… Is yours that way too?
15_Text=Not at all, huh? Yeah, that sounds about right. I didn’t think you could grow coffee beans here in Spring… This weather. No…yeah.
8_Text=Now, now… It doesn’t mean I don’t eat my vegetables, ’cause I do.//I do! Seriously!//I just don’t do it for fun…or have more than the recommended amount.
2_Text=See you around!
17_Text=So, are you the type of person who drinks hot coffee in Summer?
30_Text=Some people are immune to Winter, it seems.//Saw <NPCName>Macy</> walking around in shorts the other day.//<portrait=happy>I was shocked… Impressed in a way, but yeah, no. I can’t do that. Ha ha!
29_Text=Some warm drinks for the day?
18_Text=That’s what I’m talking about!
11_Text=The beach isn’t the place to sell coffee. Not freshly brewed, anyway. In cans, yeah, maybe! //With the beach’s unpredictable wind, blowing sand around… Yeah, no.
9_Text=The coffee maker at the shop is weather resistant.//It can withstand rain – snow even!//It was costly…but worth every penny.
13_Text=The coffee shop opened as usual during Winter.//But we closed when it got too cold… Thankfully, those days are behind us now.
32_Text=The inn gets really cold in Winter.//<portrait=happy>Thank goodness for portable heaters.
24_Text=There’s something about drinking hot chocolate in Fall, isn’t there?//Something special about it…
7_Text=Vegetables? As in <Italic>raw</> vegetables?//None for me, thanks. I’m not big on vegetables. Fruit, on the other hand…
3_Text=We’re open every day… Weather permitting, that is.
4_Text=What a beautiful day to be outdoors.//I think I might go to Garden Lane tomorrow before work and enjoy my morning beverage while looking at butterflies. Hmm…//<portrait=happy>No, yeah… I will definitely do that.
16_Text=Will you be planting coffee beans this Summer?
219_Text=<NPCName>Leah</> hates rainy days. She says they mess up her hair.//<portrait=happy>I say, just let the rain give it a wash. It’s one less thing you have to do!
247_Text=<NPCName>Leah</> loved the snow when she was a little girl, but now she just prefers to stay inside.
206_Text=<NPCName>Leah</> loves to sit on the beach in Summer.//I’ve never actually seen her get in the water, though.
186_Text=<NPCName>Leah</>’s a pretty impressive photographer.
65_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> and I are good friends with <NPCName>Bree</> and <NPCName>Walter</>. That’s why we seem to be in the vineyard a lot. We appreciate similar things.
211_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> isn’t a big fan of the water temperature this time of year.
197_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> keeps threatening to use some of my books as firewood if I don’t read them.//I told her I’m getting there, I’m getting there! Or maybe I’ll just read all of them when I retire.
191_Text=<NPCName>Ling</>’s been telling me about all the plastic she’s found in the ocean recently.//The country needs to pass some stricter laws about all that pollution.
263_Text=<NPCName>Millie</> and I have actually been close friends for a long time.//She always lets me check out more books than I’m supposed to.//<portrait=happy>That’s the only rule I ever break!
80_Text=<NPCName>Sam</>’s carrot stock is low…//Ah, no. I’m hoping to add them to my Spring frittata.
38_Text=A lot of judgment comes from fear and ignorance.//If I teach the kids diversity, hopefully, it’ll open up our world to them a little bit.
110_Text=Ah, that reminds me. I need to get my flu shot as soon as possible.
2_Text=Ah, yes. <PlayerName>$player</>! It’s nice to meet you.
64_Text=An impossible task, however. It’s easy to get carried away in front of the TV right after work.
95_Text=And maybe in Fall, I can touch on diverse festivals around the world and how some parts of the world celebrate harvest festivals.
119_Text=As long as we’re careful, a little rain shouldn’t stop us from carrying on with our day.//<portrait=normal>Dress appropriately, though.
120_Text=As long as we’re careful, a little storm shouldn’t stop us.
241_Text=As much as I’d love to talk with you, you caught me on my way home. Let’s chat another time when I’m warmer.
58_Text=Bananas are technically berries, because they come from flowers that have a single ovary.
85_Text=Being a farmer must be relaxing. You get to be outdoors most of the day.
190_Text=Bless your heart. Go sit down and have a nice cup of coffee. It’ll perk you right back up, I promise!
117_Text=But not today, right? With the rain pouring down like this.
198_Text=Buying books and actually reading them are two different activities, I’ve learned.
250_Text=By golly, if those kids are pranking me again…
246_Text=Can you feel yourself getting smarter and more thoughtful?
223_Text=Can you imagine what life would be like if it could rain indoors?//It’d be the darndest thing.
133_Text=Carrots add that extra crunch to a salad.//My favorite thing to do with them is add them to Spring frittata.
104_Text=Crunchy leaves.
121_Text=Dress appropriately, though.
124_Text=Even without a set time, the kids are pretty consistent about arriving before 9 am, and we’re usually done before 4 pm.
102_Text=Fall must be a busy time for farmers. What are you most excited about this season?
177_Text=Feel free to join me whenever it strikes your fancy. I’m always happy to have someone to talk about Tolstoy with.
131_Text=Feel free to snoop around!
109_Text=Flu can be very nasty.
97_Text=For the youth, that is. The air is too humid for me. I can’t stand it. I’d rather stay indoors.
66_Text=Further, farther… Hmm. Actually, an easy way to remember is “farther” has the word “far” in it, so it’s for distance.
157_Text=Have you been up to the mansion yet? If not, you should really take a look. <NPCName>Ling</> and I keep the most wonderful library inside.
182_Text=Have you been up to the mansion yet?//If not, you should really take a look. <NPCName>Ling</> and I keep the most wonderful library inside.//It's on the second floor of the house...inside my office.
28_Text=Have you ever tried?//<portrait=normal>Don’t write it off until you give it a go, <PlayerName>$player</>.
261_Text=Have you seen all the books they have here?//It’s enough to make my poor old heart sing with joy.
142_Text=Her mother and I got together too young.//We both grew.//Neither of us was the same person when we parted ways.
49_Text=Hmm… Listen to this idea. Weekend meals will be only fresh vegetables and fruits.//What do you think?
107_Text=Hopefully, they’ll get to display them tomorrow.
168_Text=How’s the farm going, <PlayerName>$player</>? Any new plot lines in your life?
146_Text=I always see <NPCName>Millie</> working here. She rarely leaves her area…//She’s very focused.
262_Text=I always take my class on a yearly field trip to the library.//It helps show them it’s a fun, useful place, even if they can just look everything up online.
143_Text=I can mostly do everything myself, but it’s nice to have some help…//Who’s better at knowing where to find reading material than Ms. <NPCName>Millie</> herself?
257_Text=I can’t believe how beautiful this town has become.//It seems like only yesterday it was a tiny little place in the middle of nowhere.
164_Text=I can’t wait to teach the kids about “The Great Gatsby” and “The Color Purple.” They’re not quite old enough to read those, but they’ll be there eventually.
178_Text=I could see <NPCName>Valentina</> as the protagonist of a book.//She’s sharp as a tack—the best in her class, actually.
199_Text=I do a unit on conservation and the environment every year for my class.//The kids are too young to understand the scientific details behind it, but if I can get them to recognize throwing trash in the ocean is bad, I’ve done my job.
169_Text=I do all the curriculum design for Starlet Town Elementary.//Everyone has a strong opinion about what they want their kids to learn.
194_Text=I don’t mean literally writing.//Everyone writes a story simply by living.
237_Text=I don’t mind that one bit, but I’ll definitely be tired tomorrow.
236_Text=I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight in weather like this.//Looks like another long night of reading.
209_Text=I get the feeling this year’s harvest will be a bountiful one.//Thinking about all the concoctions I’ll be eating soon makes my mouth water!
147_Text=I have to check out the museum and see if they’ve added more artifacts…
187_Text=I hear she has quite the following on social media, too.//Her mother and I always knew she would be an artist.
233_Text=I hope your work is over soon, <PlayerName>$player</>.//These sorts of storms were made for curling up at home, not running around outside like a headless chicken.
87_Text=I leave for work a little early to enjoy the Summer sun.
235_Text=I like falling asleep to the sound of rain, but this is a little too much.
126_Text=I like to achieve something every day, even if it’s just a little bit.
63_Text=I like to relax at home after school on the weekdays. Mostly because I prefer to prepare for my next class as soon as possible. That way, I don’t have to think about it on my day off.
127_Text=I lock up at night and on the weekends.//Basically, whenever we aren’t here.
171_Text=I love spending my evenings with <NPCName>Ling</>. The two of us sit by the fire and talk about what we learned that day or what new discoveries she made in her work.//<portrait=normal>I don’t see how life could get better than this.
188_Text=I made the mistake of reading past my bedtime last night.//As fun as it was, these aging bones can’t handle late nights like they used to.
71_Text=I might go to the vineyard tomorrow…
23_Text=I need to return a book to the library tomorrow.
41_Text=I only hope they’ll teach future generations to be open-minded.
183_Text=I promise it’s not nearly as fancy as the name implies.//That’s just what the folks around here have always called it.
203_Text=I saw <NPCName>Leah</> taking some very artsy photos of flowers the other day.//It made me happy someone is preserving and sharing the island’s beauty.
227_Text=I saw <NPCName>Suki</> running in the rain earlier.//How does she do it? There’s no way on this green earth I could motivate myself to get wet and sweaty.
50_Text=I should extend my weekend walks farther sometimes.//<portrait=normal>It would be a good habit.
75_Text=I still have some extra time this weekend. So I think I’ll make some dessert to take to class tomorrow.
21_Text=I take a book and a light lunch to Hillside. You know, the Vineyard.//It’s easy to lose track of time over there.
220_Text=I think <NPCName>Valentina</> said she wanted to play volleyball tonight.//Looks like that’s not going to work out in this weather.
212_Text=I try to have a hot mug of tea and a blanket ready for her when she gets home from work.//It’s the least I can do.
108_Text=I urge the kids to keep active during Winter. Hopefully, we can keep them healthy the whole season.
53_Text=I usually pay out of my own pocket, yeah… But sometimes, we do get parents who donate a massive amount of supplies to the school. It helps us a lot.
170_Text=I usually stick to the tried-and-true.//<portrait=normal>If it worked for me, it’ll work for them!
141_Text=I wish <NPCName>Leah</> and I could spend more time together, like we did when she was younger, but she has other interests these days.
33_Text=I wish I could convince the governor to give us more funding.//But it’s already a struggle for them to keep the school running.
161_Text=I wish I could stay and chat, <PlayerName>$player</>, but I’ve got a few tests to grade.//Let’s take it easy over some coffee another day.
230_Text=If I’m not careful, my tie’s going to blow away out here.
217_Text=If it keeps raining like this, the kids won’t be having recess anytime soon.
192_Text=If people knew it was against the law to litter, maybe they’d think twice about it.
160_Text=If your coffee is thick and strong, you can do no wrong!
176_Text=It feels like a good day to drink a glass of wine and read some Tolstoy.
130_Text=It may not be the worst thing. You can probably concentrate better, being away from the noise like that.
140_Text=It must be the view.//<portrait=normal>I have a feeling even burned food would taste delicious here.
243_Text=It must have been awful to be an old-timey author in Winter.//No central heat, having to keep a steady supply of firewood in the house…
113_Text=It seems like it’s been snowing less and less lately.
48_Text=It wouldn’t be a bad idea for me to eat less fish on the weekend.
255_Text=It's good to take breaks here and there.//It's good for your mental health.
252_Text=It’s a wonderful—and terrifying—feeling.
204_Text=It’s almost time for my yearly library declutter!//Time to put away all the books I’ve been reading over the Winter and replace them with some brand-spanking-new titles.
215_Text=It’s amazing to think the same water that flows through our rivers and lakes ends up in the sky as rain.
144_Text=It’s been a while since I’ve read a great series.//The last one that held my attention must have been the Peppity Witch Adventures.
9_Text=It’s good to have opinions, and important to know how to deliver them effectively.
137_Text=It’s hard to be upset when you’re this relaxed.
86_Text=It’s hard to stay in a confined room all day and not get stuffy. I tell ya…
15_Text=It’s important to stretch every hour or so, especially if we sit long hours every day…
134_Text=I’m craving Spring frittata, but we have no carrots whatsoever…//<portrait=concerned>Gah!
40_Text=I’m hoping that teaching t different views and values from all over the world can help the kids be open-minded.
148_Text=I’m jealous of you young folk who move to the island. Wide-eyed, fresh-faced, all ready to start your hero’s journey.//What a great feeling that must be.
34_Text=I’m not convinced about adding camping trips to the curriculum.
99_Text=I’m not my best self in the Summer… I can’t think properly.
139_Text=I’m not sure what’s in here, but I can taste the flavor all the way to my bones.
98_Text=I’m secretly glad Summer is over soon. I just feel so sticky all the time.
7_Text=I’m trying to get the kids to love reading.//And also, to form their own opinions independent of their peers…
94_Text=I’m trying to teach relevant subjects. For instance, I’d like to teach them a thing or two about coral reefs worldwide.
81_Text=I’ve been making it without carrots.//<portrait=normal>Bad decision, I tell ya! You can taste that there’s something missing.
195_Text=I’ve been thinking about starting an after-school reading club at Starlet Town Elementary.//Do you think the kids would like that?
16_Text=Keep that in mind, <PlayerName>$player</>!
3_Text=Kids are always watching us adults.//They’re very observant.
184_Text=Like I always say, <PlayerName>$player</>, it doesn’t matter what you read, as long as you keep reading.
135_Text=Living here has its perks. For one, we are very close to Sam’s.//So whenever we run out of things, we can just pop by.
253_Text=Look at this place.//I’m so lucky I get to work here every day.
251_Text=Looking out into a classroom is like looking into a crystal ball.//You can see what the future holds with each and every kid in your class.
240_Text=Looks like all the snow is starting to freeze over. Cold enough out here for ya, <PlayerName>$player</>?
74_Text=Maybe I can start teaching some world history soon. I think the kids will be ecstatic!
156_Text=Maybe I should ask <NPCName>Valentina</> if she can interpret for me.
224_Text=Maybe I should write a novel about that.
216_Text=Mother Nature is a sight to behold.
239_Text=My class challenged me to a snowball fight the other day.//Naturally, they won. I just can’t move as fast as they can.
189_Text=My goodness, <PlayerName>$player</>! You look exhausted.//I know farming is hard, but I didn’t think it was quite that bad.
1_Text=My name is <NPCName>Randy</>. I’m an elementary school teacher. What did you say your name was?
42_Text=My pet peeve is when somebody says it’s too late to go to school.//What’s yours?
62_Text=My wife, <NPCName>Ling</>, can be a good source if you’re interested in finding out more about coral reefs. <NPCName>Betty</> is another good source.
150_Text=Nah, I’m just pulling your leg—or maybe your arm! The kids just love that story.
8_Text=No easy task, let me tell you. Because kids can be…//<portrait=happy>Shall I say…persistent in their opinions and in their way of convincing others.
79_Text=No reason… But I thought I might teach the kids a little bit about farming.//Haven’t decided yet.
244_Text=No wonder everyone who lived a hundred years ago was sad.
101_Text=No, no. Not about the free mooncakes… Well, that too, probably. But they said they can’t wait to see the pumpkin booth.
72_Text=No, not for the wine. The view from Hillside is just amazing.
22_Text=No, not today. Tomorrow, maybe…//Going to Hillside would force me to get out of the house and walk.
128_Text=Not afraid of crimes, no… More like wild animals.//<portrait=normal>I don’t want animals wandering into the building and destroying the classroom.
35_Text=Not because of the kids. It’s just that we already live so close to nature, I don’t think it’s necessary…//On the other hand, it could help them bond as a team.
52_Text=Now and then, I submit a big order for school and art supplies to <NPCName>Luke</>.
18_Text=Now, the first part is easy.//<portrait=happy>The second one is a whole different lesson plan.
229_Text=Now, this is a gale! You ought to call it a day in this type of weather, <PlayerName>$player</>.
24_Text=Oh darn. Did I leave the book at school?
159_Text=Oh good. It’s almost time for another cup of coffee!//<portrait=normal>There’s just something about hot drinks that really keeps me going.
207_Text=Oh, how I love Fall! Authors have sung its praises since what feels like the beginning of time. It’s the season of crisp breezes and veggies aplenty.
260_Text=On warm nights, there’s nothing better than standing here with a book, taking in the scenery.//It’s a right pleasant way to spend an evening.
138_Text=One of my students lives in this area…//He lives down the road, in that house. You see?
181_Text=One thing that’s great about being a teacher is I always get weekends off.
6_Text=Oops! Said too much.
103_Text=Pumpkin. Pumpkin pies, pumpkin everything!
166_Text=Questions don’t normally stump me, but the other day <NPCName>Ling</> asked me which author, living or dead, I would eat lunch with. I started at the wall like a nitwit for at least half an hour.
225_Text=Rain is always a nice sound to fall asleep to. I won’t need to use my sound machine tonight.
208_Text=Reading in front of kids sets a good example for them.//If they see you reading, they’re more likely to try it for themselves.
13_Text=School here is from Monday to Friday, 9 am to 4 pm…//My hope is the kids feel school is more like an informative playdate than work.
136_Text=Second of all, it’s close to the tavern.//<portrait=happy>You know, for the lazy nights…
149_Text=So there I was, facing off with the alligator deep in the jungle. I was tired and hungry, but the gator looked hungrier.//I managed to escape…but not before he took my arm with him.
155_Text=Sometimes I can’t make heads or tails of what <NPCName>Leah</>’s saying.//It’s like she’s speaking another language.
259_Text=Sometimes I try to chase them, but they’re always faster than me. Maybe I’d be faster if I cut back on the wine.
210_Text=Sometimes the Fall harvest comes a little later than usual, but all we can do is wait. There’s no rushing nature.//She knows what she’s doing.
5_Text=Sometimes, I grade tests in front of the TV, watching a game or two.//<portrait=happy>Heh, heh. Only sometimes…
201_Text=Spring always symbolizes new beginnings in literature. It’s the season of love, renewal, and growth.//<portrait=happy>Or the season of pollen, if you’re allergic.
96_Text=Summer is the time to visit the beach.
26_Text=Sunday is a sports day…//For me, anyway. You’re free to do what you please.
92_Text=Suppose I’ve been going to Hillside on weekends for a while now.
105_Text=Sweating less. Cooler air in general.
25_Text=Taking a weekend stroll, <PlayerName>$player</>?
179_Text=That <NPCName>Suki</> knows what she’s doing. I need to ask about her organizational methods.//And <NPCName>Antonio</> of course.
69_Text=That’s the plan, anyway. Sometimes, I change the agenda, so the kids don’t get too bored from doing the same thing.
4_Text=That’s why we must model correct behavior in front of them.//You understand, I’m sure?
200_Text=The animal and plant species on Coral Island are so interesting.//I know <NPCName>Ling</> moved to the island because there are species here she couldn’t study anywhere else.
234_Text=The crack of thunder is such a majestic sound. Unless it’s too loud, and it makes all the kids in your class jump.
129_Text=The forest must get pretty quiet at night.//<portrait=normal>I can’t imagine living in such seclusion.
70_Text=The kids always seem more excited on Friday.
83_Text=The kids and I are going to attend the Cherry Blossom Festival. I hope to see you there.
180_Text=The kids are always hard to teach on Fridays.//They want to skip right past their lessons and go straight to the weekend.
106_Text=The kids are excited about pumpkins too.
100_Text=The kids are excited about the Harvest Festival.
125_Text=The kids need to finish their reading for the day before I dismiss the class.
213_Text=The mansion gets quite drafty in Winter, so we have to plug all its cracks and keep the heat going all the time.
51_Text=The path to the lookout through your farm is a good route.//<portrait=happy>Or better yet, I could just go back to the woodlands through the forest.
32_Text=The school can always use volunteers.//<portrait=concerned>We don’t have the funds to hire more teachers, unfortunately.
205_Text=The season of salt and sweat is upon us! I’m always grateful for every one of Coral Island’s seasons.
29_Text=The youth are our future… Whether we want to admit it or not, we’re responsible for preparing them.
122_Text=There are a couple of books here that were donated by the town’s library.//We made a deal to cycle the books every year. That way, the kids get to read new books more often.
43_Text=There is no such thing as “too late to go to school.”//The least we can do is support anyone who wants to educate themselves, not shame them.
132_Text=There isn’t much to showcase here. We don’t travel much.
84_Text=There was way too much delicious food yesterday!
82_Text=There will be no school this Wednesday.
123_Text=There’s no set time for school to start or end since we don’t have that many students.
165_Text=There’s so much to be learned from literature.
167_Text=There’s too many to choose from! I’d rather have a five-minute snack with ten of them than a full lunch with any one person.
226_Text=These are the nights wine was made for. It’s one of life’s greatest pleasures.
196_Text=They get to read fun stuff, but they also get extra reading practice.//I think it’s a win-win.
218_Text=This has turned into a bit of a chilly rain. I’d better get home soon.
231_Text=This one’s my favorite, too! I can’t let it blow away.
214_Text=Those help a lot, but you still need a blanket if you go too far away from the main room.
27_Text=Watching games live is a different experience.//Even if you don’t follow sports, the atmosphere is unmatched.
258_Text=Watching kids run through the yard makes me feel young again.
221_Text=Watching the rain run down the windows makes me feel like a wise old author.
39_Text=We may be secluded here in Coral Island.//But I’m making sure they’re aware of the wider world.
254_Text=Well, I didn’t quite finish grading those papers last night, but that’s okay.//I’ll just tell the kids I decided to take the night off.
245_Text=We’re in the most quiet and contemplative environment, the snowy night.
68_Text=We’re learning about the island on Thursdays and a little bit of science toward the end of the day.
112_Text=We’re living in the middle of nowhere, so it can take a while to restore power after a blackout. Perhaps it could be the whole day.
228_Text=We’re two very different people.//You’ve gotta respect her discipline.
73_Text=What a great weekend! It’s nice to stretch a little.
238_Text=What a jolly great day! Snow has a way of making everyone feel like a kid again.
202_Text=What a year for blooms! Spring always looks good on Coral Island, but this year seems even more spectacular than usual.
93_Text=What can I say? I like a little structure in life.
145_Text=What do you mean you’ve never heard of the Peppity Witch Adventures?!//<portrait=happy>Get out of here!
222_Text=What do you use to keep the rain off you? A raincoat? An umbrella?//Do you just run through it and hope for the best?//<portrait=happy>The kids like that option.
256_Text=What kind of skills does it take to be a farmer? You probably have to know how to count and be decent with money too.//I bet you have to know how to care for animals and how to deal with people when you sell your crops.
193_Text=What sort of story do you think you’ll write while you’re on Coral Island, <PlayerName>$player</>?
59_Text=What’s an ovary in flowers? That would be a lecture for another time.
185_Text=What’s keeping your attention these days?//Adventure books? Romance novels? The funny pages in the paper?//If only newspapers were as widespread as they used to be.
67_Text=Whereas “further” is for non-literal ideas, like when I ask you, “How much further are you going to talk about this?”
78_Text=Will you be growing carrots this year?
111_Text=With the inevitable snowstorms, I just hope we don’t lose electricity.
14_Text=Yeah, a lot of days, huh? But I thought it would be better that way.
232_Text=You ought to head home, <PlayerName>$player</>.//These sorts of storms are even more dangerous at night.
249_Text=You wouldn’t happen to know where my lesson plans went, would you? I just set them down here a moment ago.
242_Text=You’d think the kids who live around here would hate snow because they were born and raised on an island, but they can’t get enough of it.//That really tickles me.
248_Text=[<NPCName>Randy</> looks like he’s busy with teaching.]
9_Text=A customer!
12_Text=Don't be too loud.//I don't <Italic>technically</> have a permit to...//<portrait=surprised>Nevermind.
15_Text=Don't see anything you like at my shop?
13_Text=Err...yeah? What?//What is it?
4_Text=Gonna buy something?
5_Text=I can't promise I will be here tomorrow.//Might be needed somewhere else.
6_Text=I don't live here.//I have a family you know.
11_Text=I don't sell my costumes.//But maybe if you're willing to pay premium. Heh heh.
8_Text=I might bring in different items next time.//<portrait=happy>So check my store open.
2_Text=It's nice to get out of the boat every now and then.//It's certainly less shaky.
3_Text=It's not a good idea to leave my boat too long.//What if I had a buyer.
7_Text=Oops...didn't see you there.
1_Text=Thank you for stopping by. Anything I can get you?
14_Text=WHOA! You surprised me there.//<portrait=panic>For a second there I thought you were...
10_Text=Welcome! What can I get you?
124_Text=<NPCName>Emily</> loves artisan oils. So once, I thought I’d give her the oil we had in at the store at the time. Gosh, was I wrong!//She hated it.
62_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> can help you upgrade your crops by upgrading the quality of the seeds.
34_Text=<NPCName>Luke</>? Oh, no. He sells electronics. Are we talking about the same <NPCName>Luke</>?//I get my items delivered here by boat or through <NPCName>Ben</>. He’s rather cheap.
169_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! Have you had dinner?
165_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>, you look like you’d be a good chess player. We must have a game one of these nights.
90_Text=Are you listening to my advice? This is all-important. You will understand soon enough.//<portrait=unimpressed>Youth.
108_Text=Are you listening to my advice? This is all-important.//You will understand soon enough.
54_Text=Be careful carrying the scythe around. You don’t want to cut your plants accidentally.//<portrait=unimpressed>Oh, good, good.
86_Text=But of course, the island would need to improve first, and in the meantime, I would hope nobody’s selling their property to them.
103_Text=But that’s life. Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do and get on with it.
163_Text=Certain people complained that I don’t do rebates. That is false! I do, in fact, do rebates.//But only for select customers who purchase over a specific amount.
5_Text=Do you need anything? I’m usually open from nine to five.
24_Text=Do you think they’re lazy?
154_Text=Excuse me, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m trying to get my wife home before we freeze to death.
149_Text=Excuse me, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m trying to get my wife home before we get soaked.
148_Text=Fortunately for us, this place is close by, so we don’t have to walk too far in the rain.
141_Text=Fortunately for us, this place is close to the house, so we don’t have to walk too far in the rain.
153_Text=Fortunately for us, this place is close to the house, so we don’t have to walk too far in this freezing weather.
173_Text=HEY <NPCName>JIM</>! Did you hear that? Hah hah!
134_Text=HEY, <NPCName>JIM</>! Did you hear that? Ha ha!
156_Text=Hello, Farmer <PlayerName>$player</>! It’s great to see you here. Looking for the most profitable seeds?
1_Text=Hello… <PlayerName>$player</>, isn’t it?//It’s nice to see more people choosing to work with their hands.//It’s very rare in this day and age.
82_Text=How can I be presentable if my tie isn’t straight? Disaster!
81_Text=How’s my tie? It got crooked earlier while I was shelving some flour.
174_Text=I always enjoy the walk here.
78_Text=I always say to the youngsters, one must look the part to play the part.
138_Text=I can’t dance as much as I used to. With work and daily responsibilities, there’s less time to practice.
30_Text=I don’t see it as a problem. Don’t you have a chest?//I haven’t met a farmer without one, so I assume you do.
161_Text=I don’t see the need to do discounts, since I always price my items as low as I possibly can.
28_Text=I get most of my supplies from neighboring islands.
33_Text=I get some of my supplies from neighboring islands. And from you, of course.
15_Text=I get some of my supplies from neighboring islands.//And from you, of course.
63_Text=I heard she can also upgrade your animal feed!
14_Text=I like the smell of the ocean.//It’s fresh and a little salty.
125_Text=I offered to close the store and spend the day with <NPCName>Emily</> tomorrow, but she insisted otherwise. So I think we’ll just have a quiet birthday dinner at home.
17_Text=I only sell seeds for a specific season. So if you want to grow sugarcane in the Fall, you’ll need to save the seeds yourself.
29_Text=I only sell seeds for a specific season.//So if you want to grow sugarcane in the Fall, you’ll need to save the seeds yourself.
57_Text=I open at noon on Sundays.//It gives me a little more time to enjoy my morning coffee outside.
45_Text=I purposely took a day off today. I want to spend the day with people who are important to me.
55_Text=I sell bread and cookies.//Not just seeds, <PlayerName>$player</>
157_Text=I suggest you plant what you want, and the rest will follow.
146_Text=I suggest you wait until the storm dies down before you plant anything because it might wreck your farm.
92_Text=I think <NPCName>Emily</> and I are bringing fresh chards to the festival… Yes. Some chards!//That’ll be good.
98_Text=I think it’s time for another haircut. My hair is getting so long.//My oh my!
49_Text=I took a day off yesterday. I wanted to spend the day playing chess.//<portrait=unimpressed>Relaxing and whatnot.
137_Text=I used to be the dancer in the friend group. Can you tell?
6_Text=I wish more people would take up farming. The soil here is so fertile.//We can grow literally anything. If you ask me, I think people are too comfortable to do work that requires labor…
39_Text=If you pay attention, they broadcast general information about Coral Island on the local network sometimes.
117_Text=If you’re looking to farm this Winter, <NPCName>Ben</> is your best bet.//I don’t carry many Winter seeds, but he may have some that are cold-resistant.
151_Text=If you’re looking to farm this Winter, your best bet is <NPCName>Ben</>.//He may have more Winter seeds after his Fall shenanigans.
167_Text=In good time…
80_Text=Indeed. They’re just like us.
83_Text=It is <Italic>indeed</> Thursday.//Is something the matter?
143_Text=It would’ve felt so much colder in here if we hadn’t been dancing earlier.
121_Text=It’s going to be a slow Winter… I can already tell.
172_Text=It’s important for me to beat these folks at chess every week. Ha ha! To make sure they know who’s actually the best!
133_Text=It’s important for me to visit these folks often to make sure I can still beat them at chess.
79_Text=It’s important to water your plants every day so they get the nutrients they need to grow big fast.
76_Text=It’s important to water your plants every day so they get the nutrients they need to grow big fast.//<portrait=normal>Indeed. They’re just like us.
170_Text=It’s nice of you to visit! One of these nights, I must challenge you to a game of chess.
147_Text=It’s nice to go out every once in a while, even if it’s raining like this.
152_Text=It’s nice to go out every once in a while, even if it’s snowing like this.
9_Text=It’s nice to see I’m not the only one working hard around here… A foreign concept to some people.
89_Text=It’s not a bad idea to keep some seeds on hand so you can get a head start next year!
164_Text=It’s probably a good thing it’s not more well known.//I’d hate to have to deal with more people complaining about it.
100_Text=It’s probably not pleasant to be right by the oven so early in the morning in this kind of weather.
102_Text=It’s probably not the most pleasant work to be by the oven in this kind of heat.
32_Text=It’s still somewhat accurate, no?
85_Text=I’m not too worried about the folks at Pufferfish.//When they move in here and see how we’re home to exotic fish, I hope it changes their mind.
123_Text=My wife’s birthday is coming up, and I’m not sure what to get her.
67_Text=No need to be overly impressed, <PlayerName>$player</>.//That is indeed how television works.
126_Text=No, no, no. Not my birthday.//It’s for her birthday.
105_Text=Nonsense. If it isn’t your busy season, then you must make it so.//<portrait=normal>It’s Summer, <PlayerName>$player</>!
166_Text=Not tonight. Tonight is no good… I’m finishing up a puzzle, and I need full concentration.
171_Text=Not tonight. Tonight is no good… My show is on.
162_Text=Now, keep in mind I only sell the best quality items, <PlayerName>$player</>. At this price, they’re basically free!
4_Text=Of course I am. I’m very proud of our system.//It won’t work for every business, but we’re pretty small here. I think it’s working all right so far.
7_Text=Of course, I would do it. But if I start farming, who would do this?
22_Text=Of course, I would do it.//But if I start farming, who would do this?
168_Text=Oh, it’s a bit odd having you here so late. It’s definitely not something I’m used to yet.
56_Text=Oh, no, no. I don’t. If that worries you, rest assured I don’t go anywhere near the oven. Heh, heh! <NPCName>Eva</> does the baking.//She’s a good baker.
77_Text=Oh, you cleaned up a bit, didn’t you?//You look nice! Presentable and very respectable.
84_Text=Oops! Errr… No, it’s Sunday. It isn’t Thursday.
23_Text=People are slow on Friday.//Why is that?
129_Text=People have complained about the store being too cold, but unfortunately, I have to keep the cooler on to ensure the produce stays fresh.
50_Text=Puzzles are good for the mind. It’s a mental exercise to keep your brain sharp.
64_Text=Puzzles are good for the mind.//It’s a mental exercise to keep your brain sharp.
69_Text=Ready for the new week?
46_Text=Relaxing and whatnot.
114_Text=So the store is always a bit chilly in the Fall.//Can’t do anything about it.
136_Text=So you tell me, <PlayerName>$player</>. As a farmer, how do you deal with this weather?
155_Text=Some green tea would be lovely, wouldn’t it?
132_Text=Still got a lot of errands to run, <PlayerName>$player</>?
145_Text=Still got a lot of errands to run?
110_Text=Summer vegetables are crunchy and vibrant.//They’re the best for the assorted grilled platter.
47_Text=Sunny sells fresh seafood here and there. It depends on what he gets from <NPCName>Theo</>.//It isn’t always good.
135_Text=Thankfully, it didn’t storm, huh?
159_Text=That’s the best price I can give you. Take it or leave it.
175_Text=The Tavern is one of the oldest buildings on this island. Aside from the mansion, that is.//It’s been refurbished many times, so you probably can’t tell.
91_Text=The cherry trees near the lake are blooming again. Which means it’s the time of the year when we gather around the lake and barbeque.
122_Text=The first week in, and I’m already ready for Spring… *sighs*
58_Text=The islanders like the Tavern. It's called Fishensips now...it used to be the Tavern, back in the day when their dad ran it.//People go there on weekend nights especially, if you want to catch them.
130_Text=The store is always a bit unbearable in the Winter.//Can’t do anything about it.
48_Text=The store is closed today. If you need anything, stop by tomorrow.
70_Text=The store is especially busy on the first Monday of every season.
144_Text=The thunder has been nonstop like this since I woke up!
12_Text=The weather forecast is never 100 percent correct, but it’s still worth paying attention to.
31_Text=The weather forecast never 100 percent correct, but you might still want to pay attention to it.
150_Text=There aren’t many vegetables that can survive Winter here, so I don’t carry that many seeds.
93_Text=There’s still time to start planting, <PlayerName>$player</>. Just make sure to read the description to find out the lifespan of the plant.
106_Text=There’s still time to start planting, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Just make sure to read the description to find out the plant’s growth cycle.
95_Text=They’re self-sufficient, you see.
104_Text=This must be a pretty busy season for you, huh?
118_Text=Though I’m not sure when he’ll be back from his Fall shenanigans.//You’re on your own with that.
94_Text=Trees take about four weeks to grow. It’s longer than other plants, but the good thing is you don’t need to water them all that much.
19_Text=We have profit sharing here, <PlayerName>$player</>.//On top of her salary, <NPCName>Eva</> gets some of the profit from sales of baked goods.
3_Text=We have profit sharing here.//On top of her salary, <NPCName>Eva</> gets part of the profit from the baked goods sales.
158_Text=Welcome! Are you shopping?
51_Text=Why, of course. Every other day, no skipping for me. We need to keep our brains sharp, <PlayerName>$player</>.//<portrait=normal>It’s a muscle that needs its exercise.
65_Text=Why, of course. Every other day, no skipping for me. We need to keep our brains sharp, <PlayerName>$player</>.//It’s a muscle that needs its exercise.
38_Text=Why, of course. Every other day, no skipping for me. We need to keep our brains sharp.//It’s a muscle that needs exercise like any other.
44_Text=Why, yes. I might be there too. Dancing, maybe.
59_Text=Why, yes. I might be there too.//<portrait=happy>Dancing, maybe.
8_Text=Working hard, <PlayerName>$player</>?
2_Text=Yes, I own the general store, but nobody’s buying anything lately.//I had to scale down…a lot. Look at it! The store is pretty much dead.//<portrait=annoyed>That oil spill last year <Italic>really</> kicked us in the butt.
66_Text=You can watch television every day. The content usually changes daily… Usually.
99_Text=You can’t tell?//Are you being polite? *sighs*
40_Text=You do have a television, don’t you?
139_Text=Yum… Delicious.
1_Text=Oh, you remind me... I need to drop off some trash at the dumpster today.
155_Text=*mumbling to himself* Is it <NpcName>Frank</> or <NpcName>Rank</>?
130_Text=*singing* Duuu du du duuu duu duuuuu…
103_Text=*singing* Mmm shupadu wawa hmmmm~
263_Text=<NPCName>Charles</> hates when it storms at night. He says he’s worried something will fall on the house.//Worries too much, that one.
39_Text=<NpcName>Frank</> made us one of his experimental recipes last weekend.//<portrait=happy>Heh heh… Wowza! You, <PlayerName>$player</>, need to try it. Even if it’s just this once.
158_Text=A nice hot bath sounds excellent right about now.
182_Text=Ah, I didn’t get anything valuable today.
237_Text=Am I ready for Winter?//<portrait=normal>Hmm… I guess so.
153_Text=And these artifacts know things that you and I will never figure out.
87_Text=Another Spring…another year begins…another birthday season for me.//Yep, my birthday’s on the twelfth. Two days after the Cherry Blossom Festival.
145_Text=Another year has passed.
2_Text=Anyhow, my name is <NPCName>Scott</>. Welcome to town!//Don’t be a stranger!
25_Text=Anything new going on?
288_Text=Anything that makes me move is cool with me.
78_Text=Are there, like, giant mermaids or something?
228_Text=Are you growing anything new this year, <PlayerName>$player</>?//A big turnip and okra salad sounds delicious right about now.
169_Text=Are you out fishing too, <PlayerName>$player</>?
120_Text=Aww, me too… I woke up yesterday with bug bites on my ankles.//<portrait=angry>Ankles, <PlayerName>$player</>!
151_Text=Be part of the history, yeah?
232_Text=Beach games are the best way to pass the time in the Summer.//<portrait=happy>Anyone up for a game of cornhole in the sand?
163_Text=Besides, listening to <NpcName>Frank</> is better than TV.
96_Text=Better soak up the last of that Summer sun, <PlayerName>$player</>.
207_Text=Between working in the cavern and hanging out, I hardly get any time to myself these days.
12_Text=Both kinds! We handle artifacts from the cavern and the sea.//<portrait=normal>Cleaning them takes different approaches.
178_Text=But I still wear armor, you know… Just in case.
183_Text=But at least I got a good workout in the cavern.
47_Text=But some solution is needed to break through the crust.//So there’s a balance that we archeologists have to keep in mind.
70_Text=But, nah! Can’t be. *laughs* All right, that’s enough psychotherapy for one day.
118_Text=Can you tell?
199_Text=Can’t get divorced if you don’t get married! That’s my philosophy.
241_Text=Cold doesn’t really bother me, I guess… But it’d be nice to wake up to Summer tomorrow.//<portrait=happy>Ha ha! Asking too much, I know.
107_Text=Cool when it’s Summer, warm in Winter… That sort of thing.
249_Text=Coral Island has more rain than any island I’ve ever been to.
176_Text=Did you bring vitamins with you?
131_Text=Did you catch the melody, <PlayerName>$player</>? I forget what it’s called.
187_Text=Did you hear what happened at the Tavern last week?//<portrait=normal>It was wild. <NPCName>Pablo</> did a cartwheel off the counter, and everyone cheered.
162_Text=Do you come here often? I do.//The food’s good, and it’s close to the house and my work.
31_Text=Do you know how to make green smoothies?//Because <NpcName>Alice</> and <NpcName>Suki</> love them.
129_Text=Do you know this song? For some reason it’s been stuck in my head. It goes…
256_Text=Do you think the rain will stop soon? I don’t pay attention to the weather forecast.
200_Text=Do you think the town would let me start a cornhole festival?//<portrait=happy>Probably not. I’d win every year.
258_Text=Don’t the big fish come out when it’s raining?//<portrait=happy>I wanna go catch some, but…I’m too lazy.
100_Text=Don’t you think jazz is the perfect background music for Fall?//Love jazz. It’s the best music… Smooth and all that.
246_Text=Everyone on the island seems to like Winter the most, but I’m really more of a Summer guy.//<portrait=happy>What’s not to love about sweating it out on the beach?
238_Text=Fall is the perfect time of year for some good jazz.//<portrait=blushing>Don’t the falling leaves and the crisp breeze make you think of saxophones and trombones?
234_Text=Fall is the time of year when people get into relationships, right?//So they can meet each other’s families during the holidays.
221_Text=Find me next time you’re at the Tavern and I’ll have <NPCName>Frank</> fix up something special for you.//<portrait=happy>Or better yet, I can fix it up!
171_Text=Fingers crossed, <PlayerName>$player</>. It might happen again!
69_Text=For a second there I thought I might be the problem.
147_Text=Friends are important to me.//So I try my best to set aside some time every week to keep up with them.
268_Text=Gold was so valuable in the ancient world.//If they wanted to remember something, they usually immortalized it in gold.
172_Text=Growing up, Dad would wake me up early on the weekend to go fishing at sea… At around 4 am.
53_Text=Ha ha… What are we? Monsters?
128_Text=Have you got those holes in your shoes?
216_Text=Have you seen the stuff <NPCName>Ben</> has in his caravan?//He finds some neat items sometimes.
116_Text=Have you started working on your farm yet?//There must be a lot of weeding to do.
111_Text=Having breakfast outdoors is different in Winter… Do not recommend it.
217_Text=He found a gold necklace once and put it on his duck.//<portrait=happy>What a guy!
253_Text=Hello? Is that you, <PlayerName>$player</>? I can hear you, but I can’t see through all this rain!
270_Text=Here’s a weird question for you.//If you’d lived thousands of years ago, what would you want to leave behind for people to remember you by?
164_Text=Hey, <NpcName>Frank</>! I want to make sure you heard what I just said!
286_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>! You and I should have a fishing competition one day. We can see who catches the biggest fish.
144_Text=Hmm… I’m going straight home after work.
287_Text=Honestly, I’d rather be lifting weights or jogging, but yoga’s cool too.
276_Text=Honestly, rock climbing was pretty good preparation for working in a cavern.//<portrait=sad>But it does seem dangerous doing it here.
231_Text=I can’t believe it’s already Summer.//Sure feels like Winter was just a couple of days ago.
72_Text=I can’t seem to get past the third chapter. You haven’t read it, have you?//I just need to know the gist of it.
24_Text=I can’t wait to go to sleep tonight.//Worked out pretty hard this morning… Now I’m all fatigued.
170_Text=I caught myself a couple of pink snappers within ten minutes of each other, this one time.//I’m still amazed about it, to this day.
142_Text=I couldn’t go back to bed after that.
66_Text=I cut through your farm on my way to the cavern and saw how much work you’ve put in. I have newfound respect for you.
91_Text=I did a new workout regimen for Winter.//It was a fifteen-day thing. Can you tell?
195_Text=I did that in college, and it was awesome.//<portrait=normal>Gah, I miss those days.
18_Text=I didn’t get to stretch this morning.//<portrait=annoyed>I feel my back tightening up.
181_Text=I didn’t hear you. This cavern can get a bit creepy.
60_Text=I don’t just work at the museum, <PlayerName>$player</>.//I also do my own digging on Thursdays.
126_Text=I don’t know how long my hair can survive in this heat.
94_Text=I don’t know if it’s the Summer heat, or… I don’t know what, but the temperature in one of the shafts in the cavern is extremely high lately.//Weird thing is it’s just that one, though… Like something is flaming inside.
45_Text=I don’t know.//<portrait=sad>Coffee and I just don’t mix.
99_Text=I don’t mind the walk to the forest, especially on nice Summer days.//I get to see what <NPCName>Dinda’s</> planting, see what <NPCName>Joko’s</> up to. All that stuff.
33_Text=I don’t miss the city as much as I thought I would.//<portrait=concerned>There’s not much there for me to miss.
225_Text=I don’t really get cold, I guess.//<portrait=concerned>I guess I’m just THAT hot.//<portrait=happy>Ha ha! Just kidding!
215_Text=I don’t really miss the city.//The sunsets here are much nicer… In the city, all the buildings and traffic lights block your view of the sky.
123_Text=I feel sticky… Yuck.
140_Text=I figure I’ll keep inside today.//I’m trying not to get too much mud inside the house.
34_Text=I find all kinds of things inside the cavern.//<portrait=annoyed>Some of them are very…weird.
5_Text=I found a couple of empty bottles in the forest yesterday.//<portrait=annoyed>How’d those get there?
28_Text=I get it. Not a big violet fan myself.
121_Text=I grew up fishing with my dad. We would wake up early on the weekend, around 4 am, and catch a boat to go fishing at sea.
137_Text=I guess I’ll just heat up yesterday’s leftover tacos for dinner.
243_Text=I guess you don’t want your milk and eggs to come out frozen.
159_Text=I had a full day today… I think I deserve to unwind a bit before heading home.
262_Text=I hate going into the cavern on days like this.//<portrait=annoyed>Hearing thunder while you’re deep in a cavern tunnel is just too creepy.
127_Text=I have these holes in my shoes that keep my feet nice and cool.
242_Text=I heard <NPCName>Kenny</> say at the ranch that you gotta keep your animals inside during the Winter.//Is that true?
209_Text=I heard some people at the Tavern say they like swimming in the ocean, which is awesome! Lots to see down there, I’m sure.//<portrait=happy>Me? I’m more of a forest guy myself.
138_Text=I hope they’re still good. Hmm…
168_Text=I just don’t have time to make my own bait.//<portrait=concerned>Besides, <NpcName>Charles</> gets cranky when I start making a mess at the house.
75_Text=I just had this epiphany about how little I know about this island.
285_Text=I keep asking for one for my birthday, but no one around here seems to be able to catch one, either.
76_Text=I keep finding these brand new pieces of history that make no sense at all. For example, I found a giant spoon at sea one time.
274_Text=I keep it going all the time… Sometimes even overnight.
198_Text=I kinda feel bad for <NPCName>Suki</>.//<portrait=concerned>She seems to be doing well with her ex, but she still had to go through a divorce.
166_Text=I know I complain about <NpcName>Charles</> sometimes, but I’ll miss him if he ever decides to move on.
191_Text=I know there’s tons of fresh veggies and stuff, but sometimes you just really want fast food, you know?
273_Text=I know what you’re thinking, you know. “What’s that sweet sound? And why does it make me feel so happy and relaxed?”//<portrait=normal>It’s none other than the smoothest of smooth jazz, presented by yours truly.
79_Text=I like <NpcName>Charles</>, but he can be a bit uptight.//Sure, I leave the fridge door open every once in a while, and I’ve accidentally eaten his food, but…
92_Text=I like having breakfast outdoors while looking at the flowers.//Something about it… Especially Spring flowers.
30_Text=I like this place, Coral Island.//It shows there’s more to life than climbing the corporate ladder.
17_Text=I like to go to the Tavern to catch up with my crew on the weekend.
139_Text=I like to spend my weekends drinking coffee in front of the house, when it isn’t raining.//You know, doing some people watching.
67_Text=I like working off-site as much as I do on-site. I’m glad I decided to move here. There are a lot of spots to dig.
105_Text=I live by the water. It’s nice and cool in the morning.
13_Text=I love my job.//We get to check out artifacts that have been around for hundreds of years.
62_Text=I made the best falafel the other day.//I’m so proud of myself.
36_Text=I meant me, not you.//Mining just tires me out.//It’s insane!
254_Text=I need to cover up my artifacts.//<portrait=sad>Or else all the moisture outside is going to make them rust.
135_Text=I need to make sure to stock up on tea leaves.
239_Text=I need to tell <NPCName>Charles</> to turn the heat up in the house.//It’s really starting to get cold out here.
83_Text=I personally am not big on flowers. But what flowers do you like, <PlayerName>$player</>?
219_Text=I remember my mom telling me once, but I totally wasn’t paying attention.//Hmm…
265_Text=I remember this drink my buddies and I came up with, called Stormy Night.//<portrait=happy>Every sip made you roar like the storm!//<portrait=normal>Wanna try it sometime?
89_Text=I see more and more people outdoors now the weather is <Italic>livable</> again…
203_Text=I should probably be quiet when I get home tonight.//<portrait=annoyed>Last week <NPCName>Charles</> got mad. Apparently I was “too loud” when I came in.
194_Text=I should start a Coral Island singles club.//We could all live in the same house and throw big parties where we invite other singles.
81_Text=I should stop bringing work home with me. It’s caused one too many incidents.//This one time, I was cleaning up my geodes in the kitchen. Some gravel must have flown out, and it ended up in <NpcName>Charles</>’s burrito…
174_Text=I smell like the ocean.
63_Text=I think I used too much hair gel today.
244_Text=I think I’ll actually have to wear long pants when I go digging now.
179_Text=I think I’ll go out for a bit and have a snack by the creek.
68_Text=I tried dating before. Three serious relationships, in fact. I guess I’m not that good at it, because they all crashed and burned.
52_Text=I try to always have my bag with me.//How else am I going to carry everything I find?//<portrait=annoyed>With my bare hands?
235_Text=I used to date this girl who loved the Fall.//She would jump into big piles of leaves and carve pumpkins.
21_Text=I wake up tired, but I can’t ever remember anything. Huh.
98_Text=I want to play volleyball tomorrow at the beach. I wonder if there’ll be anybody there to play with me.//<portrait=concerned><NPCName>Chaem</> maybe? Or…//<portrait=normal>Will you be there?
257_Text=I was going to go down to the pier today, but the rain wouldn’t let up.//<portrait=happy>Oh well! At least I get to see you.
212_Text=I went to this one party in college where everything was decorated in gold.//<portrait=annoyed>Not just a gold color, but actual, legit gold.
19_Text=I woke up too late again.//Maybe I’ll do some quick stretching later, after work.
236_Text=I wonder if there are big leaf piles where she is now.
284_Text=If I could just catch a red king arowana one of these days, I’d be a happy man.
152_Text=If you think about it, these artifacts and fossils right here are like silent witnesses.//They’ve seen things, <PlayerName>$player</>, that you and I have never even thought about.
51_Text=If you’re lucky, you can even find weapons.//<portrait=concerned>Now, how they got there in the first place, nobody knows…
93_Text=If you’re okay with humidity, you should visit the cavern in Summer.//It’s usually pretty cool inside.
134_Text=In less than three weeks, it’ll be the new year. I’m psyched!
240_Text=Is it just me, or does Winter seem like the quietest season?//<portrait=normal>Someone needs to turn up the volume out here.
283_Text=Is there any way to tell if the big fish are out today? They should do a Coral Island fish forecast.
261_Text=It better not be raining again tomorrow.//I’ve got things to do.
148_Text=It may sound crazy, but I think it’s incredible to be working on these artifacts.//I think of it as interacting with our ancestors. Because I kind of am.//These artifacts take me back in time.
269_Text=It turns out that when something’s rare, it becomes more valuable.
213_Text=It was cool. Definitely one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences.
8_Text=It was nice and quiet.//I could use more of that in my life.
109_Text=It’s Winter again. Time does fly when you’re having fun!
224_Text=It’s finally warm!//<portrait=normal>I would say I can go back to wearing shorts again, but I’ve actually been wearing them all Winter.
204_Text=It’s not my fault <NPCName>Charles</> was in bed at eleven o’clock on a Friday.
42_Text=I’d be careful going into the cavern, if I were you.//In case you slip and accidentally get a mouthful of moss.
211_Text=I’d call it the <NPCName>Scott</> Seltzer!//<portrait=normal>That has a nice ring to it, right?
167_Text=I’m brushing up on my fishing.//Just a little hobby I like to do in my spare time.
26_Text=I’m feeling tired today.
88_Text=I’m getting back into my routine now… I can get to the cavern more easily.//The path to the forest isn’t so slippery now the snow’s melted.
23_Text=I’m more like the light-stretching-before-bed type.
56_Text=I’m not a weapon kind of guy, so I limit my mining to level 2.
255_Text=I’m not going out in that downpour without an umbrella.//<portrait=normal>Got one I can borrow, <PlayerName>$player</>?
165_Text=I’m not stressed about growing old. But to be honest, I’m kind of worried I might have to do it alone.
201_Text=I’m pretty sure no one’s beaten my mini golf score yet.//<portrait=happy>Think you’re up for the challenge?
37_Text=I’m ready to get back to work! Last weekend was wild.//The people here are so much fun.
97_Text=I’m ready to soak up the sun!//<portrait=annoyed>And if you’re going to remind me about sunscreen, don’t worry. I get an earful every day from <NPCName>Charles</>.//Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen…
117_Text=I’m so sore. I’ve been lifting a lot lately.
157_Text=I’m so sore… I’ve been lifting a lot lately.
186_Text=I’m still trying to catch my breath.
73_Text=I’m technically working today. I’m just not in the office.
44_Text=I’m trying to cut back and get my caffeine from tea instead.
71_Text=I’m trying to read this book that <NpcName>Millie</> turned me on to. “The Fairy Tales of Dulca,” or something like that?
57_Text=I’ve been practicing with a saber, but it isn’t a one-and-done type of situation, you know?//Maybe one day, when I master it, I’ll dig deeper into the cavern.
220_Text=I’ve been seeing a lot of you recently. You sure do get around, don’t you?//<portrait=happy>It’s kind of nice.
208_Text=I’ve seen people around here pull in some pretty big fish from the ocean.//<portrait=concerned> Makes me wonder what else you could find down there.
214_Text=I’ve tried to get <NPCName>Charles</> a date, but I struck out.//He just wants to sit at the bar and give unsolicited medical advice…//<portrait=annoyed>He’s never going to find a partner like that.
252_Text=Jeez, I can’t even get fresh air out here without taking in a mouthful of water.//<portrait=concerned>Is this how fish feel?
9_Text=Last weekend I walked around town and had lunch on the empty land next to <NpcName>Frank</>’s.
279_Text=Let’s get some more drinks going in here! Next round’s on me!
149_Text=Like a time-travel portal! A glimpse of what life was like… A quick look at how the world was hundreds of years ago.
110_Text=Lots of animals hibernate in Winter… Ever wonder which ones hibernate in the caverns?
82_Text=Man, was he mad at me! Apparently he bit into gravel and “almost lost a tooth.” I actually felt awful.
133_Text=Maybe you can bring us some more of those artifacts from the cavern.
223_Text=Might as well just put it off…forever.//<portrait=happy>Ha ha!
206_Text=Mom always made sure the fridge was stocked with food and snacks and whatever.//<portrait=happy>What a champ!
119_Text=My Summer did not start out great, but thanks for asking.//<portrait=normal>How’s your Summer so far?
95_Text=My cavern-o-meter isn’t a fancy one, but even it picked up the different temperatures of the shafts.//It’s weird. You see, caverns don’t usually do that.//Even in Summer!
233_Text=No takers? No worries.//<portrait=normal>I can just beat my personal best on my own.
132_Text=Not many plants can survive the Winter snow. I hope this means less work for you.
3_Text=Oh man, you reminded me…//I need to drop off some trash at the dumpster today.
124_Text=Oh, I’m not too worried about mosquitoes. They prefer one particular blood type over the other.//And mine happens to be “the other.”
250_Text=Oh, I’ve been to plenty of islands!//<portrait=normal>I’ve been around, you know. What’s the point of being young if you don’t travel?
74_Text=Oh, right. I don’t work in an office… But you know what I mean.
104_Text=Oh, sorry, <PlayerName>$player</>. I just had this jazz melody in my head.
271_Text=Oh, that’s neat! For me, I think I’d want to keep a notebook.//<portrait=happy>That way I could tell future generations what life was like when I was around.//<portrait=normal>It doesn’t really matter, though, since I’m here now.
114_Text=Oh, yeah! Pufferfish Corp! There you go.//<portrait=annoyed>Fitting name, don’t you think?
277_Text=Okay, I have a joke for you. I’ve been wanting to tell you this one ever since I first saw you come into the cavern.
43_Text=On my second cup of tea today.
160_Text=One more over here, <NpcName>Frank</>!
90_Text=One of my worst heartbreaks happened in Spring… It was the second grade.//We were in the same class. She rejected the worm I found outside and went to play on the monkey bars with Aiden… I wonder how that guy’s doing now…
16_Text=One of those days, you know?
27_Text=One thing I noticed about people here is they tend to like wildflowers.//<portrait=normal>Speaking of, though, I’ve heard some people don’t like violets…//So, watch out for that.
55_Text=Or is it Thursday nights? Hmm…//I don’t remember.
222_Text=People like to get married in the Spring, don’t they?//<portrait=annoyed>Why would you want to get married when there’s all this pollen in the air?
115_Text=Phew! That New Year’s Eve dinner was unreal!//<portrait=happy>So many fruit pies to choose from.
248_Text=Rain isn’t too bad. I don’t even notice it when I’m in the cavern.
259_Text=Rainy days make me feel like curling up with tea and reading… And I don’t even like to read.//<portrait=happy>Weird, isn’t it?
108_Text=Remember to be extra careful walking to the forest. Icy path and all.
275_Text=Rock climbing? Here?//<portrait=concerned>Hmm… I guess you can, if you really want to.//<portrait=annoyed>I don’t encourage it, though.
175_Text=Salty.
218_Text=Since you’re here, let me ask you a question.//<portrait=concerned>What’s the best way to fold a shirt?
266_Text=Snow day!
54_Text=Some of my friends meet up at the community center on Wednesday nights.//They share their feelings and support each other, and stuff.//You can join them, if you want to.
150_Text=Some of the artifacts here are ones I found.//A small contribution, but it feels good to give back to the field I’m passionate about.
281_Text=Stay tuned, <PlayerName>$player</>. I’m gonna do something cool soon!//<portrait=normal>I just don’t know what.
64_Text=Still look good, though, right?//I’m not stressed about it.
49_Text=Still look good, though, so I’m not stressed about it.
113_Text=The Catfish Corp, I think?
226_Text=The Spring rains erode the cavern a little more each year. Over time, more artifacts and gems are uncovered.//<portrait=happy>Don’t quote me on that, though. That’s just my theory!
106_Text=The air in the cavern is much warmer than outside, especially with the snow everywhere.//Rocks are great insulators. Caverns stay relatively the same temperature year round.
50_Text=The cavern in the forest is surprisingly deep.//There are all kinds of things buried down there.
245_Text=The cavern is freezing this time of year.
125_Text=The cavern is wild, though. The mosquitos attack no matter what… Maybe because there are no other targets down there.
101_Text=The ground in Fall feels a bit different than in other seasons. That’s the first thing I notice, usually.//That and the leaves changing color.
112_Text=The mayor came by to the library the other day and told us a drilling corporation’s moving into town.
230_Text=The one thing Coral Island has over the city is beach life.//There’s nothing like blasting a cannonball right into the waves.
267_Text=The snow makes my hair go flat.//Do you think it looks flat?//<portrait=normal>Phew! Don’t worry about yours, your hair also looks fine!
141_Text=The thunder woke me up at two o’clock this morning!
227_Text=There are bad things about rain too, if you think about it.//<portrait=annoyed>For one, if you don’t get to the artifacts in time, the rain can give them a beating. Heck, even destroy them!//<portrait=happy>That’s also my theory.
102_Text=There are so many mushrooms in the forest now.//I don’t do that kind of thing, but if you like them, you should go forage around.
146_Text=There were things I wish I would’ve handled differently.
205_Text=There’s nothing better than okra and turnips. They remind me of my mom’s cooking.
192_Text=There’s so much cool stuff in the cavern, but no one likes to get their hands dirty down there.//It’s too bad.//<portrait=happy>More for me, I guess!
85_Text=They are pretty, aren’t they? But I can’t have flowers at home. <NpcName>Charles</> won’t stop sneezing if I do.
210_Text=They need some new drink recipes down at the Tavern.//<portrait=concerned>I wonder if there’s anything they could make with turnips and okra.
229_Text=They say the biggest fish come out in the Summer.//You wanna see if I can catch any monsters down at the pier?
197_Text=They should play more jazz at the Tavern.//<portrait=blushing>It would give it that classy, ritzy feel. Know what I mean?
280_Text=Things are starting to get a little dead around here.//<portrait=concerned>What can I do to get everyone fired up again?
260_Text=Think you could surf in weather like this?//<portrait=happy>I bet the waves would be, like, higher than my house.
184_Text=This is a nice spot for a lunch break.//I might cool my feet in the creek afterward.
40_Text=Tick it off your bucket list!
11_Text=Time to get back to work.//<portrait=happy>Monday, huh?
61_Text=Ugh, but I draw the line in at digging in Summer.//The cavern’s cool but can also get too stuffy...if that makes sense.
80_Text=Um… It sounds worse when I say it out loud. Hmm…
4_Text=Wait, did I offend you? I meant it as a compliment.//<portrait=happy>You look like someone who recycles a lot, for some reason.
173_Text=We would bring our lunches and sail home at sunset.//Then Dad and I would stop by a ramen place on the way home for dinner.//We’d cook up our catch the next day.
20_Text=Weird dreams wake me up a lot.//It’s annoying, if you ask me.
272_Text=Welcome to party central! Make yourself at home.//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Charles</> might disagree with that characterization, but hey!
247_Text=Well, I was going to host a party outside tonight, but I guess that’s not going to happen.
154_Text=Well, of course I know some of it… But yeah.
14_Text=Well… It’s not all old. Most of what we get turns out to be junk.//<portrait=normal>But it’s awesome when we get an artifact that’s both rare AND old.//Feels good to be part of the discovery.
122_Text=We’d bring our lunches and sail home at sunset. Then Dad and I would stop by a ramen place on the way home for dinner. We’d cook up our catch the next day.
65_Text=What a farm you’ve got!
161_Text=What a great way to end the week.
15_Text=What are you up to?//I don’t do much on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.//I usually just go to the museum and then right back to bed.
278_Text=What did the miner say when he walked into the cavern? //<portrait=happy>He said, “Wow, this place ROCKS!”//Where’re the laughs?
190_Text=What’s your favorite thing to eat around here?//<portrait=concerned>I’m starving.
46_Text=When I clean artifacts, I try not to use too much chemical solution because I’m afraid it might damage them.
77_Text=Why would there be massive cutlery at sea? I’m talking about a huge spoon, as big as our faces.
6_Text=Yeah, of course I did.//I brought the bottles and tossed them in the dumpster on my way home.
32_Text=Yeah, the twins. Wait, you knew they were twins?!//<portrait=normal>I couldn’t believe it when I first found out.
185_Text=Yikes! Something came at me in the dark, so I ran as fast as I could.
156_Text=You freaked me out. Say hi next time, will you?
35_Text=You get so tired after mining all day, yeah.//<portrait=sad>Wow…
188_Text=You gotta come hang out with us one night.//It’ll be the time of your life, I promise!
84_Text=You like tulips? I don’t, personally. I don’t know… They just don’t do it for me.
282_Text=You might not know this, but I was captain of the billiards team when I was in college.//<portrait=normal>They called me <NPCName>Scott</> the Pool Master.
22_Text=You strike me as the type who reads every night before going to bed.//Am I right?
38_Text=Your weekend was fun, I hope?
29_Text=You’re a farmer, right?//Let me ask you something. Is a passion fruit the same as a fig?
1_Text=You’re from Pokyo, huh?//<portrait=normal>I came from a metropolitan area myself. The Big Apple… You’ve heard of it, I’m sure.
41_Text=You’re not allergic to moss or anything, right?//<portrait=normal>Because there’s lots of moss near the cavern.

9_Text=<NPCName>Alice</> and I are twins, correct… But no, I can’t read her mind.
160_Text=<NPCName>Alice</> and I grew up here. But I guess you already knew that. I remember playing around the town when I was <NPCName>Valentina’s</> age… Building rows of snowmen.
140_Text=<NPCName>Alice</> and I grew up here. But I suppose you already knew that. I remember playing around town when I was <NPCName>Valentina’s</> age. Building rows of snowmen.
225_Text=<NPCName>Antonio</> and I fought last night. That rarely happens, so it bothers me when it does.//<portrait=concerned>He said I’m too naggy about <NPCName>Valentina</>.
249_Text=<NPCName>Antonio</> and I used to spend Fall going to concerts and music festivals. I can’t really see myself doing that anymore.
233_Text=<NPCName>Brooke</>, <NPCName>Charles’s</> ex, used to go shopping with me at Wabanana.
256_Text=<NPCName>Rafael</> and <NPCName>Pablo</> bring <NPCName>Valentina</> too many gifts this time of year.//They’re going to spoil her!
193_Text=<NPCName>Rafael</> and <NPCName>Pablo</> come to the inn a lot.//<portrait=happy>They’re great uncles to Valentina. Their whole family is very affectionate… Lovey-dovey, you know?//<portrait=normal>I’m grateful <NPCName>Valentina</> was born into their family.
194_Text=<NPCName>Rafael</> or <NPCName>Pablo</>? What?! Neither of them is my ex.//<portrait=happy>My ex-husband is <NPCName>Antonio</>… One of their cousins.
155_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> always gives me a hard time at bedtime…//Whenever I complain to her father about it, he just says she doesn’t do it at his place.
113_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> can be VERY excessive when it comes to accessorizing her snowmen. She sneaks and takes my robe, my hat…//Some of the things she takes are Wabanana, you know…
93_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> gets really active in Summer. I think she’s excited to go out and play with her dad.
267_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> hates thunder.//I should make sure she’s okay.
201_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> is the same way. She gets bored quickly.//<portrait=normal>Thankfully, her dad keeps her active with things like volleyball and rock climbing.
189_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> keeps asking if she can go to the forest by herself.//<portrait=annoyed>I just don’t think it’s safe.
173_Text=<NPCName>Valentina</> needs to clean up that room of hers, or she’s not playing at the beach tomorrow.
91_Text=<NPCName>Valentina’s</> birthday is coming up soon. It's on Summer 3rd.//<portrait=annoyed>Should I have a big birthday party at the inn, or should we just go for a picnic at the beach?
272_Text=<NPCName>Valentina’s</> hoping for a day off from school tomorrow.//If it keeps snowing like this, she might get it.
165_Text=A bit stuffy in here. We need to open more windows…
78_Text=A lot of cleaning up to do today…
133_Text=A lot of people are very dedicated to this island.//It was great to see all of us together yesterday.
196_Text=According to this book I’m reading, we should all be more grateful. It’s supposed to lead to a fifteen percent increase in happiness within two weeks.//<portrait=happy>I’m giving it a try. I mean, why not?
242_Text=Ah, it’s my favorite time of year! Know why? It’s time for Spring cleaning!//<portrait=happy>Out with the old, in with the new!
77_Text=And get this, yeah? <NPCName>Alice</> also took an astrobiology class on the search for extraterrestrial life. I don’t know what she was thinking…
142_Text=Animals can have a positive effect on our mental health. Did you know that? I’ve tried having pets, but they don’t seem to like the inn very much.
143_Text=Are you going to <NPCName>Bree’s</> dinner party on the twenty-eighth? I don’t know if I should bring wine or something.
84_Text=Are you ready for Spring cleaning, <PlayerName>$player</>? I know I am. I’ve prepared for this all year.
270_Text=Be careful on your way home. You wouldn’t want to be struck by lightning or anything.
30_Text=Besides, we get our wine from Hillside Vineyard…//Their business seems to be doing well, so whatever they’re making must be good.
178_Text=But I haven’t returned the books we borrowed last week.//<portrait=annoyed>I wonder if <NPCName>Millie</> will make a big deal out of it.
288_Text=Cakes, pizza… They’re so heavy. I usually get really bloated the next day.//<portrait=happy>Sorry if that was too much information. Ha ha!
152_Text=Careful on your way home, okay, <PlayerName>$player</>?
183_Text=Come here to play?
210_Text=Deep breath in, deep breath out. Peace from within.
261_Text=Didn’t the weather forecast say it wasn’t going to rain today?
297_Text=Diving? No, thank you. I think I’ll just relax here.//You should, though.
232_Text=Do you know of any good places to get exercise gear?//Wabanana is great, but I can try other brands if you have any suggestions.
41_Text=Does the air smell musty to you?//I’m worried the inn might have mold.
73_Text=Don’t know if you do know this, but… I used to be fun, <PlayerName>$player</>. Now I get excited for a trip to the grocery store.
56_Text=Don’t know if you know this. But I used to be fun, <PlayerName>$player</>. Now I get excited for a trip to the grocery store.
212_Text=Don’t tell anyone, but I may have eaten one strawberry too many yesterday.//They’re so sweet! I’m not usually a big fan of strawberries, but I could eat some more, to be honest.
265_Text=Either way, I still have to get my to-do list done! Please excuse me.
235_Text=Even though <NPCName>Antonio</> and I got divorced, I’m happy for the time we had together.//I have <NPCName>Valentina</> because of him, after all, and he’s taught me a lot about myself.
271_Text=Even though I don’t like Winter, the snow does make the inn look pretty.//It makes the whole town look pretty, actually.
236_Text=Every once in a while, I think about <NPCName>Antonio’s</> parents. His mom made killer burritos.//<portrait=happy>I wonder how they’re doing.
104_Text=Fall is really nice, isn’t it? Very beautiful.
180_Text=Flowers are a little expensive here. So I usually get them from <NPCName>Ben</> instead.//Besides, I sometimes buy out-of-season flowers that <NPCName>Sam</> doesn’t carry.
156_Text=Gah… Of course she doesn’t do it with him. I don’t even want to know what time he puts her to bed.//<portrait=annoyed>I’m sure that’s why <NPCName>Valentina</> doesn’t give him trouble.//<portrait=concerned>Midnight bedtime, for crying out loud!
176_Text=Going fishing, <PlayerName>$player</>?
111_Text=Good news! We have enough blankets for the guests…I think.//Let’s hope!
74_Text=Gotta love the new me, I guess.
161_Text=Great memories all around.
170_Text=Guests are welcome to take a book to read in exchange for one they’re finished with.
204_Text=Have you ever gone for a sunrise jog on the beach?//It clears your head.
44_Text=Have you ever tried making eggplant lasagna? It’s delicious, and it’s really easy to make.//But you do need a ceramic bowl.
252_Text=Have you made your plans for Winter yet, <PlayerName>$player</>?//Now’s the time to get started.
145_Text=Her father takes her climbing all the time, and she’s good at it.
4_Text=Hmm? Oh sure. Sort of like a wake-up call.
230_Text=Hmm… I can’t remember if I told <NPCName>Alice</> to clean out the inn’s reception desk or not.
192_Text=Hmm… That’s true, but I like Rachel Abram’s version much better.//I read both hers and Tyna Smith’s “Finding Love from Within.” They’re entirely different books.
126_Text=I ate so much yesterday at the Cherry Blossom Festival.//I think I’m still full today. *laughs*
289_Text=I brought my own bag, right here! You too, right?//<portrait=happy>Awesome!
116_Text=I can’t believe I have a twin… It always blows my mind when our birthday is coming up.
293_Text=I can’t believe I missed that putt. I need to calculate my angle better next time.
248_Text=I can’t believe it’s time for <NPCName>Valentina</> to start another year of school. She’s growing up way too fast.
203_Text=I don’t know why you’d need to stay there since you have a house of your own, but the offer stands.
281_Text=I don’t know… It tasted a bit funny.
59_Text=I don’t talk about it a lot, but having a child really did something to my life. It changed me…
119_Text=I don’t think I got enough sleep… I still feel very tired.
205_Text=I don’t want my head to be too clear, though. There are a lot of things I need to remember.
123_Text=I expected to see more rain than this.
185_Text=I feel bad for saying it, but I enjoy mini golf.//It does feel like a betrayal to like it, though… I don’t know what to tell ya.
128_Text=I get fresh flowers for the inn from <NPCName>Ben</>.//He gives us a discount for buying in bulk.
254_Text=I grew up here, and I’m still having a hard time adjusting to this weather.
80_Text=I had <NPCName>Valentina</> when I was pretty young. But I want to be there for her for as long as possible.
240_Text=I had a huge to-do list I wanted to get through yesterday, but I wasn’t able to finish everything.//Normally I’d be upset about it, but I feel…okay?
287_Text=I have nothing against sweet things.//I just don’t really enjoy them, I guess.
108_Text=I have to get the blanket boxes from storage.//I’m gonna ask <NPCName>Rafael</> to do it next weekend… And I have to check the battery in the carbon monoxide detector.//I do it every year at the very least!
107_Text=I have to make sure the heaters are working properly before Winter starts… OH! And see that we have enough blankets for everyone.//<portrait=annoyed>I asked <NPCName>Alice</> to take care of the blankets a few years ago, but she missed some of the rooms, so I’m taking care of them now.
286_Text=I hope <NPCName>Sam</> stocks more fresh vegetables soon.//I’m running out of ingredients for green smoothies.
266_Text=I hope a branch doesn’t fall on the inn.//That would be expensive.
255_Text=I hope it doesn’t snow on my birthday.//I’d like to go on a jog without getting my shoes wet.
231_Text=I hope she does it regardless. It could use some tidying up.
217_Text=I hope the more people <NPCName>Valentina</> is exposed to, the more she’ll learn about diversity, and the better her social skills will be.
263_Text=I hope this clears up by tomorrow morning.//I’d rather not take <NPCName>Valentina</> to school in the rain.
268_Text=I hope we don’t lose power.//One time there was a really bad storm and the electricity was out for the whole day.//<portrait=normal>Yeah! A blackout.
112_Text=I know it's my birthday month but honestly, I don’t really care about birthdays… The best thing about mine is <NPCName>Alice</>.
29_Text=I let <NPCName>Alice</> pick our wine selection.//I don’t care about alcohol.
105_Text=I like running in Fall. It’s cool enough that I don’t feel overheated but not too cold that I feel like I’m freezing my toes off.
200_Text=I like to change up my exercise routine each week so I don’t get bored.
89_Text=I love running in Spring.//<portrait=normal>It’s so nice to hear all the animals again and see all the plants blooming.//<portrait=happy>It gives me more energy to run!
96_Text=I made some homemade bug repellent, but it doesn’t seem to work.//Or maybe the Summer bugs are just super strength…
45_Text=I make it often here.
290_Text=I miss school sometimes. It was nice knowing what came next.//After fourth grade, you go to fifth grade, and so on.
247_Text=I need to keep an eye on how much candy <NPCName>Valentina</> eats.//She’ll make herself sick otherwise.
50_Text=I need to make sure <NPCName>Valentina</> does her weekend reading.//<portrait=normal>Sometimes she gets carried away and forgets about it.
238_Text=I need to tell <NPCName>Valentina</> not to go barefoot on the beach.//<portrait=normal>Better safe than sorry.
71_Text=I never cared about my diet or lifestyle until I had <NPCName>Valentina</>. Then I became a label-reading momster. Ha!
67_Text=I never used to care about my diet or lifestyle until I had <NPCName>Valentina</>. Then I became a label-reading momster. Ha!
214_Text=I often see you walking past the inn. Been going to the diving spot, huh?//<portrait=happy>Good for you, <PlayerName>$player</>! I’m glad for people like you… People who care not only about themselves but also about our environment.
97_Text=I put out my homemade bug repellent in the lobby. It’s free for everybody to use… And if any of the guests want to, they can take a mini bottle with them.
46_Text=I put out my old sewing machine for the community to use.//It’s never too late to learn a new skill.
208_Text=I run to the forest on Monday mornings… If the weather permits, that is.//<portrait=happy>I’ll hit the woodland tomorrow morning. I usually run back to the inn after taking <NPCName>Val</> to school.
285_Text=I should get <NPCName>Rafael</> and <NPCName>Pablo</> to teach <NPCName>Valentina</> about farm animals.//Maybe she can help out at the ranch when she’s a little older.
177_Text=I should pick up some books and brochures for the inn while I’m here.
237_Text=I stepped on a rusty can during my jog this morning! Thank goodness I had my thick shoes on.
184_Text=I think the mini golf course Pufferfish built is a great addition to our town.
262_Text=I thought I’d be able to take <NPCName>Valentina</> to the beach this evening, but I guess not.
136_Text=I thought it started to snow last night, but no. *sighs*
18_Text=I try to take <NPCName>Valentina</> to school every morning.//Then I pick up some stuff for the inn on the way home.
137_Text=I was so excited.
3_Text=I went for a run in the forest this morning and got back before <NPCName>Valentina</> had to leave for school.//It’s a great start to the day.
220_Text=I wish <NPCName>Alice</> would make more friends.//Spend less time reading up on those silly things she’s so interested in and actually live her life.
273_Text=I wish I could stay and talk, but I need to find some extra blankets for <NPCName>Valentina’s</> bed.//It’s going to be a chilly night.
151_Text=I wish the school would give the kids the day off when it’s stormy like this.
101_Text=I wonder if it’d be worth it to turn on the sprinklers so the grass stays green… Or is that just a waste of water?
227_Text=I wonder what <NPCName>Valentina</> will be when she grows up.//<portrait=normal>Whatever it is, I hope she finds her passion. Her dad and I will be right there, supporting her.
179_Text=I'm here to pick up some fresh fruit and veggies for dinner. You?
202_Text=If you ever need a place to stay, you’re welcome at the inn.
275_Text=If you see <NPCName>Valentina</>, could you send her over here, please?//I want to show her something.
150_Text=It gets a bit cold in here, yeah?
94_Text=It gets pretty hot and humid living by the beach… I can’t wear too many layers.
2_Text=It’d be nice to have more farmers here.//Being able to get local produce would be a game changer.
120_Text=It’s <NpcName>Joko</>’s birthday tomorrow… Hmm…//<portrait=normal>Do you think I should get him some pineapples? Or a jar of yogurt?
39_Text=It’s Friday again. No school for the kids tomorrow.
234_Text=It’s Friday! Got anything fun planned for the weekend?//<portrait=normal>I think I’m going to take it easy.
49_Text=It’s Sunday again. The kids are back to school tomorrow.
171_Text=It’s a “take a book, leave a book” type system…//But if someone doesn’t have a book to donate, it’s okay. They don’t have to leave anything.
95_Text=It’s nice to see people getting together and cleaning up the beach.//One of my favorite things about Summer.
269_Text=It’s part of living on an island, I guess.
5_Text=It’s sad to think about, but…//If I don’t take <NPCName>Valentina</> to school now, when else would I get to do it?
239_Text=It’s so nice having <NPCName>Rafael</> and <NPCName>Pablo</> around on Sundays.//They can keep an eye on <NPCName>Valentina</> while I run errands.
134_Text=It’s starting to get chilly at night.
241_Text=I’ll just roll everything over to today. It’s not a big deal.//Wow, that feels weird to say…but in a good way.
245_Text=I’ll plant anything but violets.//<portrait=annoyed>I just hate the way they smell.
100_Text=I’m a little sad Spring is over, but Summer isn’t so bad.
182_Text=I’m feeling good today. I’m bringing my A game. *laughs*
216_Text=I’m glad <NPCName>Valentina</> is close with <NPCName>Antonio’s</> family.//With her school as small as it is, I have to make sure she gets the social interaction she needs.
296_Text=I’m in the middle of a game right now, but we should play the next round together.
117_Text=I’m looking forward to Spring.//Making my cleaning solution tonight… Getting ready for Spring cleaning. Woo-hoo!
144_Text=I’m not too worried about <NPCName>Valentina</>.//She knows to be careful when the ground is slippery.
190_Text=I’m not worried about people, really… You never know what else lives there.//<portrait=concerned>I don’t actually believe it… But nothing’s wrong with being careful, I think.//<portrait=annoyed>Hmm… <NPCName>Alice</>has gotten her outrageous theories into my head.
131_Text=I’m only here to pick up some irises for the inn from <NPCName>Ben</>.
82_Text=I’m pretty physically active, but I just can’t get into the activities my ex loves.
282_Text=I’m sorry, but I don’t feel like chatting… I’m a little tired.//<portrait=normal>Let’s talk later?
88_Text=I’m sure glad I don’t have to run in the cold anymore!//But the great thing about running is after a while, you warm up and you don’t feel the cold anymore. But starting out is hard…
197_Text=I’ve been keeping a gratitude journal for a week.//In just seven more days, I’ll be a new, happier me!
92_Text=I’ve cleaned everything on my list. Phew, right on schedule!
258_Text=I’ve heard rain is forty percent more dangerous at night than during the day.//I don’t think <NPCName>Valentina</> will be going out by herself on rainy nights anymore.
257_Text=I’ve heard rain is forty percent more dangerous at night than during the day.//I don’t think <NPCName>Valentina</> will be going out by herself on rainy nights anymore.//<portrait=normal>Ha ha! That’s right. I do like statistics.
98_Text=Lemongrass is the main ingredient in my bug repellent… It smells really strong.//<portrait=concerned>I don’t hate it… It’s just… No point using perfume, you know? It would just be overpowered.
75_Text=Let me tell you something about my sister. <NPCName>Alice</> took a neuroscience class on zombies, and they did a behavioral study to compare zombie brains to human brains.
135_Text=Make sure to bring your best produce to the Harvest Festival on the fifteenth.
226_Text=Maybe <NPCName>Antonio</> has a point… But I just want the best for her.
223_Text=Me? Nope. My grades were so-so. She must take after <NPCName>Antonio</>.//<portrait=happy>I was too busy having fun to focus on school.
222_Text=My day’s been fantastic so far! Thanks for asking.//<portrait=normal><NPCName>Valentina</> just got her report card today. All As, as usual.
65_Text=My ex’s cousin <NPCName>Rafael</> helps out with odd jobs around the inn when he comes to visit <NPCName>Valentina</> on Sundays.
125_Text=My parents never explained why they named me <NPCName>Suki</> and my sister <NPCName>Alice</>…
7_Text=My sis, <NPCName>Alice</>, is so soft-spoken. I can barely hear what she’s saying half the time.
27_Text=My sister may look small, but gosh, can she eat!//<portrait=happy>Especially when she makes minced jackfruit pie.//<portrait=normal>A healthy appetite is good!
139_Text=No big deal…
72_Text=Not even going to deny it. It’s who I am now.
90_Text=Now that Winter is over, I need to wash all the blankets and put them in storage.
291_Text=Now there’s no guide for what comes next.//<portrait=normal>Being an adult is weird. I still don’t feel like one sometimes, and I have a whole other tiny human who depends on me.
274_Text=Now, where did I put that grocery list?//I can’t remember if it’s in the budget notebook, the food notebook, or the shopping notebook. Hmm…
76_Text=Of course not. Zombies aren’t real. Don’t be silly!
195_Text=Oh my! <PlayerName>$player</>, what day is it?//<portrait=normal>Tuesday? Thank goodness. I thought I missed a day in my cardio routine.//It’s okay; I’m okay!
259_Text=Oh my! Really? Ha ha! I never noticed.//<portrait=normal>You’re right; I do like statistics.
99_Text=Oh, I better make some minced jackfruit pies for dinner with some fresh jackfruit. It’s in season now!//Sounds so yum!
85_Text=Oh, aren’t you glad Winter is over? I certainly am. Besides the snow, the cold was unbearable.
110_Text=Oh, here we go. It’s Winter again…
164_Text=Oh, here, let me show you how to make a green smoothie.//It’s delicious, and it’s a power drink too.
1_Text=Oh, hey! It’s nice to see you again.
295_Text=Oh, hey! I’m glad you’re here.//Play with me?
60_Text=Oh, in a good way, of course. Being a parent gives me a whole new purpose.
52_Text=Oh, that’s right! You’re probably friends with them, huh?//<NPCName>Eva</> and <NPCName>Macy</>?
211_Text=Okay, I’m good now. Do you need something, <PlayerName>$player</>?
122_Text=Okay. It is a healthy snack.
115_Text=Our birthday is coming soon. What should I do for <NPCName>Alice</>? Hmm…
118_Text=Phew! Quite a party last night, yeah?
83_Text=Rock climbing? Diving?//None of those.
251_Text=She LOVES red curry but can’t eat mushrooms.//Poor thing.
186_Text=She and I grew up together here…//<portrait=happy>Oh! <NPCName>Nina</>… I was talking about <NPCName>Nina</>.
32_Text=She can’t feel it when I get pinched, either.//And no, we don’t do everything together.
294_Text=So if I hit it at a forty-five degree angle off this wall…
188_Text=So, how much do I owe you?
102_Text=Some of the guests complained about the yellow grass… No, no, not recently. It was a few years ago.//I told them it’s just the way the grass is here, but they wouldn’t accept it.
43_Text=Some only visit Coral Island for the festivals.//<portrait=normal>We’re kind of famous, if you think about it.
224_Text=Someone made a huge mess in one of the rooms at the inn a few days ago.//<portrait=concerned>It took me an entire day to clean it up.
284_Text=Sometimes I bring <NPCName>Valentina</> here to calm down when she’s upset.//The peace and quiet among the trees helps her.//<portrait=happy>It helps me, too.
6_Text=Soon she’ll be all grown up, then off to university…//<portrait=annoyed>Time really does fly, <PlayerName>$player</>.
181_Text=Sorry, <NPCName>Sam</>!
221_Text=Sorry, that was rude. Those things aren’t silly.//It’s just…<NPCName>Alice</> is too focused on them, and she doesn’t have any friends.//<portrait=concerned>Well, yeah. Valid point. <NPCName>Noah</> is her friend… But that’s the problem, isn’t it? <NPCName>Noah’s</> her ONLY friend.
243_Text=Spring is the perfect time to start new habits.//Everyone’s shaking off the Winter cold and getting outside again.
246_Text=Summer is a good time to burn away bad vibes.//Just lie back on the beach and let the sun do its thing.//Don’t forget sunscreen, though!
153_Text=Take the garden lane tonight, will you?//It might be safer than going through the lookout.
276_Text=Teaching her how to keep the inn’s ledger will help with her math skills.
187_Text=Thank you for this! It will make a very fresh green smoothie. I’ll send you the recipe tomorrow.
215_Text=Thank you, <PlayerName>$player</>. You’re very cool!
8_Text=That girl needs to turn it up a notch.//Speak up more.
174_Text=That girl… When it’s time to surf or play with her friends, then she’s out the door in seconds.//But when it comes to cleaning up her room… Oh gosh!
28_Text=That’s one of her favorite dishes, by the way.//That and green smoothies… Same as me!
81_Text=That’s why I’m keeping a close eye on what I eat. No more junk food, thanks!
127_Text=The beach cleanup is an awesome thing, but we also need to remember to use less plastic and recycle.
51_Text=The inn does okay, but it isn’t crowded…//Well, not as crowded as I’d like it to be!//<portrait=happy>But we do have a few regulars.
199_Text=The inn is a great place to live.//It may not be a conventional place to grow up, under the same roof as strangers and all. But <NPCName>Alice</> and I grew up there, and we had fun.//<portrait=happy>I think <NPCName>Valentina</> will do just fine.
218_Text=The inn is always open, seven days a week.//We have to be there for the weekenders.
86_Text=The inn is so big… It’s not easy to clean it alone.//I don’t mind, though. I even make my own cleaning solution.
228_Text=The inn? Like THE inn?//Yeah, it’s ours. My parents used to run it before <NPCName>Alice</> and I took over.
158_Text=The snow is piling up outside.
132_Text=The sun sure is strong today… Be sure to stay hydrated, okay?
48_Text=There are also people who only visit Coral Island for the festivals.
219_Text=There’s always so much cleaning to do at the inn.//I don’t mind, though. It keeps me moving.
250_Text=There’s so much fresh food to cook with in Fall. It makes planning <NPCName>Valentina’s</> meals much easier.
264_Text=This is dangerous weather, <PlayerName>$player</>! Neither of us should be out in it!
278_Text=This is going to take ages to fix.
277_Text=Ugh! Alice messed up the numbers again.//I had them all clean and laid out on a spreadsheet, but she broke my columns.
114_Text=Ugh, I don’t want to give up my morning runs, but I’m seriously considering it.//<portrait=concerned>It’s so cold!
213_Text=Wait, were they from your farm?//<portrait=normal>I got them from Sam’s.
253_Text=We don’t get many customers at the inn in Winter.//I think people prefer to stay in their own houses during the cold months.//<portrait=concerned>I don’t know. What do you think?
47_Text=We get a lot of tourists who come here just to dive.
129_Text=We get things from <NPCName>Sam’s</> store too, of course…//<portrait=happy>Um… You know, bread and things like that.
169_Text=We have plenty of books in our library.//If you don’t mind well-read books, please help yourself.
157_Text=We need to find out how to crank up the heat in here.
106_Text=We usually get more guests the closer we get to the Harvest Festival.//<portrait=concerned>Some of them are up from Beluga Bay for the harvest display, and the rest are just tourists who are curious about the festival.
154_Text=Well, I just thought it might be more slippery.
79_Text=Well, that’s what weekends are for. So I might as well get to work.
168_Text=We’ll give you the local discount! Heh heh.
103_Text=We’re bracing ourselves for the oncoming Winter. You should, too.//Heater, blankets… What else do I need?
260_Text=What an ugly day. I’m glad I’m inside.
175_Text=What are you doing here so early in the morning?
58_Text=What do you have on the agenda for the week?
138_Text=What should I cook for tomorrow?! If I can’t settle on something, I’m going to skip it and heat up some leftovers.
244_Text=What sort of flowers should I plant around the inn this year?//I’ll have to check my plant notebook for ideas.
279_Text=What’s still on my to-do list? Oh, right.//I need to make <NPCName>Valentina’s</> lunch for tomorrow.
159_Text=Winter is my favorite season, and days like these are precisely why.
280_Text=Would you do me a favor and check the expiration date on the ketchup?//I think it’s going bad.
36_Text=Yeah, I make it all the time.//I know the recipe by heart.
121_Text=Yeah, I think he would appreciate it.
209_Text=Yep, correct! <NPCName>Val</> is <NPCName>Valentina</>.
167_Text=You can just relax and read a book in your room with the windows open.//<portrait=happy>Fall asleep to the calming sound of the waves…
109_Text=You can just run longer in cooler weather. You don’t get out of breath as easily.//Me, I mean…not you.
66_Text=You know him, don’t you? Yeah, he’s pretty helpful.
124_Text=You know, I have to say… Quite a name you’ve got, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Is there a meaning behind it?
229_Text=You look surprised! Ha ha! Interesting reaction.
198_Text=You meet a lot of people working at an inn.//Traveling does that too.
172_Text=You should check out the pier. There are usually tons of seals out at this time.
166_Text=You should take a break from farm life and stay here for a weekend or something.
163_Text=[<NPCName>Suki</> is singing. She doesn’t sound so bad.]

170_Text=<PlayerName>$PLAYER</>! YOU’VE TURNED INTO A TOMATO WITH ALL THE TIME YOU’VE SPENT OUTSIDE.
186_Text=A DAY LIKE THIS IS PERFECT FOR A NICE LONG ROUND OF CHESS.
59_Text=A GOOD ACTIVITY… I DON’T FISH AS OFTEN AS I USED TO.
57_Text=A LITTLE HUMILITY CAN’T HURT… THINKING THERE’S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT CAN ONLY DRIVE US TO LEARN MORE. BESIDES, EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH, RIGHT?

183_Text=YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON’T KNOW. HEH HEH.//BUT IT SEEMED TO WORK.
203_Text=YOU KNOW WINTER HAS REACHED CORAL ISLAND WHEN IT STARTS SNOWING.
194_Text=YOU LOOK A LITTLE WATERLOGGED, <PlayerName>$PLAYER</>! GO HOME AND DRY OFF.
97_Text=YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT’S REALLY OUT THERE UNTIL YOU ENCOUNTER IT.
149_Text=YOU OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING FUN TODAY, <PlayerName>$PLAYER</>! LIKE THE KIDS SAY, YOU HAVE TO TREAT YOURSELF!
179_Text=YOU OUGHT TO TAKE IT EASY THIS WINTER, <PlayerName>$PLAYER</>. YOU’VE BEEN WORKING HARD THE WHOLE YEAR.
3_Text=YOU SEE A LOT OF DEBRIS FROM THE PAST IN THE OCEAN, TOO.//A BURIED STORY, IF YOU WILL.
53_Text=YOU’RE RIGHT. IT ISN’T FOR EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW WHAT IS? FISHING.
216_Text=[<NPCName>Sunny</> is staring out over the water.]
206_Text=[<NPCName>Sunny</> seems busy behind the counter.]
178_Text=’TIS THE SEASON! IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD IS CELEBRATING IN WINTER.
189_Text=<NPCName>Archie</> is Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> and Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</>'s son. I think he wants to be a vet one day.
216_Text=<NPCName>Ben</> has some great deals in his shop!
86_Text=<NPCName>Ling</> said it sounded too formal for her, but she was more than happy to address me as Dr. <NPCName>Widjojo</> if I preferred.
183_Text=<NPCName>Luke</> runs Socket Electronics, Coral Island’s premier electronics shop. Stop in; tell him I sent you!
134_Text=<NPCName>Nina</> is smart and humble. I feel like I can talk to her all day, and I usually have a hard time chatting with people.//<portrait=normal>But with her, it just flows, you know?
15_Text=A lot to explore in here, huh?
2_Text=Actually, I also just moved here last Winter, for work.
231_Text=Another scorcher out there today.
127_Text=Apparently, she lives in the abandoned villa on the beach and now only comes here for the Summer.
120_Text=Are there really two more weeks of Winter? I don’t know if I can last through it…
33_Text=Be careful at the forest...I was in the forest when I got caught in the storm.//<portrait=normal>And listen to this. While I was looking for shelter, I found a little cave, so I went in, right?//<portrait=surprised>I mean, anyone would, at that point.
10_Text=Besides, what have you got to lose, am I right?
208_Text=But I don’t like telling people I think of myself like that.
107_Text=Coconuts are seasonal here, huh?//<portrait=annoyed>I noticed each season has a different kind of coconut… Summer is that um…macapuno coconut?//<portrait=concerned>Or is it Coral Tall coconut?
219_Text=Come to think of it, maybe I should spend more time MAKING friends…
18_Text=Coral Island has become my home away from home.//After studying the local ecosystem, I feel like I belong here.
54_Text=Coral Island has one of the most beautiful coral reefs, and I want to study it!//<portrait=normal>I’d love to spend my life doing what I can to protect it from rising sea temperatures.
203_Text=Corals aren’t actually plants. They’re animals!
173_Text=Did I bum you out?//Maybe I should stop talking about work.
193_Text=Did you know a quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs? Amazing!
232_Text=Did you know rising water temperatures are bad for the coral? It’s true! I hope we get a break from the heat soon.
205_Text=Did you know sea sponges are older than the dinosaurs? It’s true!
214_Text=Do I seem tired? I stayed up until three in the morning thinking about parrotfish.
113_Text=Do you know where I can get some bamboo shoots in Fall?//I went looking for them around the hot spring area… No luck.
204_Text=Don’t feel bad if you didn’t know that. It’s a common misconception.
138_Text=Don’t freeze at the farm, okay? Heh, heh.
187_Text=Don’t let their propaganda fool you. If they start drilling, it’ll be a disaster for the nearby coral communities!
171_Text=Dr. <NPCName>Jiang</> published a couple of books and a lot of scholarly articles about her research here.
132_Text=Dr. <NPCName>Ling</> and I recycle all the trash collected during the annual beach cleanup.
62_Text=Drinking too much milk gives me a stomachache… And it has that weird aftertaste.
190_Text=Even with a PhD in marine biology, I had a really difficult time finding a job. I applied for so many!
159_Text=Eventually, I want to publish more articles or even books about my findings.
206_Text=Everything in life is connected. The sea, the sun, the sand…
92_Text=Except for the clinic. They always have someone on call in case of an emergency.
147_Text=For some reason, I concentrate better during Winter… I think it might be the cold.//Or maybe it’s because of the quiet.
149_Text=For some reason, people feel the need to talk about the rain when it’s raining.
157_Text=For some reason, people feel the need to talk about the storm when it’s storming.
123_Text=Good point… I did come here for work.//And so did Pufferfish.
126_Text=Have you met <NPCName>Nina</>?//We met at the beach and got to talking a bit.
210_Text=Have you met many people in town yet?
186_Text=Have you seen the oil rigs around the island? The Pufferfish Corporation set them up.
196_Text=Have you tried the tacos at Fishensips? They’re delicious!//I guess it’s called Fishensips now… Back in the day, when I was a little kid, it was called the Tavern.
177_Text=He lives in Mount Yahara not far from here, but you need to take a boat and then a bus across the desert to get there.
201_Text=Hey there! How’s the farm? Catch any good radishes lately?
48_Text=He’s been taking me out on boats since I was in diapers.
73_Text=Hmm… Very meta. I never thought about it that way. I like it!//You have a great way of looking at things…I like that about you.
17_Text=How are you doing here so far, <PlayerName>$player</>?//<portrait=happy>Does it feel like home to you yet?
70_Text=How do you think they came up with the name Coral Island?
218_Text=I always work late hours, don’t I? Maybe I should spend more time with friends.
143_Text=I can’t believe I’ve already been living here for a whole year.
87_Text=I declined her offer and said we could keep the environment in the lab casual.
114_Text=I didn’t realize Winter here is so cold!
85_Text=I don’t bring my work home. It would be way too messy. Besides, <NPCName>Archie</> can be pretty noisy. It’s just too hard for me to focus.
55_Text=I don’t know what to tell you, <PlayerName>$player</>.//But I don’t think there are such things as mermaids.
197_Text=I don’t mind living with Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> and Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</>, but I don’t like the smell of sawdust.
115_Text=I don’t think I’ll ever get used to Winter…
139_Text=I don’t think I’m going to enter the cooking competition.
116_Text=I don’t understand how some people can go out in this weather wearing only two layers…
67_Text=I don’t want to be rude by calling Dr. <NPCName>Jiang</> “<NPCName>Ling</>.” But she asked me to… It felt really weird at first.
51_Text=I don’t want to see them die…//Someday, I want my kids to know what I knew and see what I saw.
215_Text=I feel so lucky to have Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> and Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> here on the island. I don’t know what I’d do without them.
211_Text=I have a hard time making new friends, myself. Maybe because I don’t like crowds…
13_Text=I have to admit that before coming here, I was very closed-minded.//I didn’t want to believe anything that hadn’t been proved by science.
175_Text=I have to remind myself it’s one step at a time.//<portrait=sad>I can’t rush it, or I might fail altogether.
224_Text=I have wide and varied interests. I like staghorn coral AND sea whip coral!
168_Text=I hope you have extra blankets in the cabin, <PlayerName>$player</>.//This snow doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.
125_Text=I know it isn’t for everybody, but that’s how I was brought up.//We need to take care of each other as a community.
223_Text=I know you know that. I just love saying it. I’m a scientist!
217_Text=I know. I was surprised too.
43_Text=I like to spend my Saturdays here.//<portrait=happy>You do too, huh?
194_Text=I like to think of myself as someone who can keep a level head. I hope others see me the same way.
192_Text=I love eating fresh vegetables from Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</>'s garden.//She's also an amazing cook.
207_Text=I love helping our local coral population. I like to think of myself as an underwater superhero!
198_Text=I love my job! Working at the lab doesn’t even feel like work.
195_Text=I love rainy days, but I hate carrying an umbrella. I’d rather just get wet.
111_Text=I love the Harvest Festival. It’s a good example of just how close-knit this community is.//<portrait=concerned>But then there are the Beluga Bay farmers…
180_Text=I love to go snorkeling. How about you?
137_Text=I need to crank up the heater tonight. It seems like it’s gonna be a heck of a night.
30_Text=I needed to collect some species for work, but I lost track of time.//It got dark very quickly… I had no idea.
63_Text=I never made the connection until a mild accident at a theme park…
84_Text=I obliged.
166_Text=I read them all and even used a couple as references for presentations back in school.//<portrait=normal>She finds fascinating subjects to cover.
172_Text=I read them all and even used a couple as references for presentations back in school.//She covers fascinating subjects.
185_Text=I really envy people who can work with their hands like that.
220_Text=I saw <NPCName>Archie</> playing with <NPCName>Taco</> the other day. It was cute! They really seem to understand each other.
7_Text=I see a lot of potential on this island, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this.//I feel like we could build the town up.
225_Text=I should probably get out more.
49_Text=I spend a lot of Summers on Coral Island. Not always on this side, though…//<portrait=normal>But I always used to spend my Summer breaks at sea, just diving and chasing fish.
16_Text=I spent my first month just hiking around the island…//<portrait=annoyed>I got lost a couple of times and ended up in the forest.//<portrait=concerned>Weird.
72_Text=I thought so too. So insightful!
117_Text=I tried diving the other day, and it was so cold! It was horrible!//How do you do it?
118_Text=I try not to go into the water during Winter. It’s too cold.// For now, above-sea-level testing only.
96_Text=I was helping Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> weed the crops.//Spring is <Italic>finally</> here, isn't it?
181_Text=I work for Dr. <NPCName>Ling</> down at the lab. She’s a great boss!
202_Text=I, uh…don’t know much about farming.
221_Text=If the Pufferfish Corporation isn’t stopped soon, sea life around Coral Island is going to be in trouble.
104_Text=If you get too exhausted at the beach – sun does that to you – go to the Beach Shack to cool off and get some coconut water.
174_Text=In the future, I want to publish more academic articles or even books about my findings.
60_Text=Interesting, indeed.
27_Text=Is everything okay at the farm?
36_Text=It took me a whole year to get to know this island and its people.
146_Text=It was so much fun last year. I definitely won’t miss it this year.
91_Text=It’s a good thing in the era of twenty-four-seven stores, I say. It teaches us patience.
229_Text=It’s finally warm enough to go to the beach again!
226_Text=It’s freezing outside! I’m glad it’s warm and cozy in my lab. I spend most of my time there anyway.
230_Text=It’s howling out there!
112_Text=It’s mushroom season, all right! Going to the forest to forage anytime soon?//Me? Nope… I don’t think so. I’m scared I might get lost.//<portrait=concerned>Maybe if I can get my uncle to come with me…
94_Text=It’s my eyes, I think. Dad and I have the same eyes. It’s in our genes.
145_Text=It’s my second year going to the Winter Fair.
53_Text=It’s not easy to find a job in this economy, but it’s not just about a job, you see.//<portrait=normal>It’s about this particular job.
228_Text=It’s so rare to have homemade clothing these days. She’s incredible!
109_Text=It’s starting to get chilly. I hope it doesn’t get any colder than this.
167_Text=It’s still snowing out, huh?//<portrait=sad>I should’ve worn a thicker jacket.
119_Text=It’s too cold, <PlayerName>$player</>. Too cold…
191_Text=I’ll be forever grateful to <NPCName>Ling</> for giving me the fellowship here on Coral Island.
140_Text=I’ll definitely come watch the contest though, because Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> is entering!
142_Text=I’ll go with the whole family to watch the contest, but I don’t think I’ll enter this year.
222_Text=I’m a scientist.
136_Text=I’m blabbering again.
29_Text=I’m embarrassed to admit I got lost the other day trying to find my way back from the forest.
32_Text=I’m kinda feeling it now.//<portrait=normal>Coral Island is starting to feel like home.
76_Text=I’m meeting a couple of friends at Fishensips this Friday. Nothing fancy, just to chat and play some pool, maybe.
99_Text=I’m so glad Winter’s over with.//<portrait=happy>I feel a lot better now…
156_Text=I’m soaking wet.//Excuse me, I just wanna be indoors.
14_Text=I’m still like that now, to a certain degree.//<portrait=happy>But some things, like fairies… They’re not too far out there, are they?
170_Text=I’m very cold.//Excuse me, I just wanna be indoors.
41_Text=I’ve always liked the ocean my whole life, and I want to spend my time here taking care of it.
56_Text=I’ve dived my whole life, and I’ve never seen a mermaid.//<portrait=normal>Also, I’ve read a lot about the ocean, and nothing ever mentioned the existence of mermaids.//I could easily be wrong, though. The world is full of unanswered mysteries.
169_Text=Keep warm, okay?
45_Text=Kinda miss the lab.//<portrait=annoyed>Work is all I can think of on my day off… *sigh*
227_Text=Like my mittens? Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> made them herself.
158_Text=Like the phenomenon is so surprising.
37_Text=Looking back, I probably should have gone out more.//<portrait=normal>That would’ve made the process faster.
44_Text=Maybe I should be more adventurous. I don’t know.//<portrait=normal>I don’t want to rush it.//There’s still plenty of time to explore in the future, right?
179_Text=Maybe I should go to the clinic and see if that’s normal.
59_Text=Mermaids?! Around Coral Island?
64_Text=Mild, <PlayerName>$player</>. It really was nothing… I’ve shared too much. Bye-bye, now.
57_Text=Milk? Eek… None for me. I don’t know.//<portrait=normal>I guess it leaves a weird aftertaste on my tongue.//<portrait=happy>Now, lodeh. That’s where the flavor is at.
47_Text=My family runs a boat company over on Puny Island.//Dad still sails as much as he can…//Any chance he gets, basically.
212_Text=My fellowship at the lab isn’t a permanent position. I hope <NPCName>Ling</> will hire me full time!
124_Text=My parents never asked too much of me.//Just to make sure I remember to share what I have with the community.
50_Text=My point is I feel like I know them, you know?//<portrait=normal>The coral reefs, the fish. I grew up with these fish…//Swimming around this kelp.
182_Text=No, she didn’t tell me to say that.
90_Text=Not sure if you noticed, but there’s not one store on this island open seven days a week.
103_Text=Now <Italic>this</> weather is meant for me, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Hot, humid, sun blazing down. Love it.
163_Text=Oh you’re still here… It’s a bit late, isn’t it?
58_Text=Oh, can you, really?//<portrait=happy>I’m impressed. I can’t make lodeh. It’s a bit too complicated for my cooking skills.
61_Text=Oh, hey! Happy Saturday!
75_Text=Oh, umm… I won’t be going out tonight. I have to be at 100 percent tomorrow.
1_Text=Oh, you’re <PlayerName>$player</>. I’ve heard about you from my uncle, <NPCName>Joko</>… The carpenter.//<portrait=annoyed>Tall? Mustache? No?
28_Text=Oh… Errr… Great talk.
52_Text=Once my fellowship with <NPCName>Ling</> is complete, I hope I get hired here full time.//<portrait=happy>Fingers crossed!
160_Text=One step at a time, though, yeah…//<portrait=happy>Don’t get too excited yet!
110_Text=One thing I like about Fall is the fresh mushrooms. You can make polenta with them, and nothing beats freshly harvested mushrooms!
71_Text=Ouch. Appreciate your honesty, I guess.
200_Text=Pufferfish Corporation is really getting out of control. Have you seen their flyers? It’s sickening!
9_Text=Reuse your cups when you can, will you?//It can start with us, then hopefully, others will pick it up.
81_Text=Silence doesn’t bother me. I’m used to being in a lab all day and night. In fact, I really can’t work well in a room full of people.
213_Text=Some coral reefs are over five thousand years old!
6_Text=Stay with me here! Close your eyes and imagine a brand-new recycling center.//<portrait=normal>The dumpsters are empty, and people are actively recycling… That’s the dream.
8_Text=Stay with me here! Close your eyes and imagine a lush community garden where people are gardening…//<portrait=normal>Chatting with each other.
4_Text=Stay with me here! Close your eyes and imagine a lush community garden where people gather…//<portrait=normal>Gardening…on a breezy Spring day.
148_Text=That said, I definitely blame the cold for waking me up early. Heh, heh.
121_Text=The New Year’s Eve Festival is going to be right behind our house… So there’s no point in not going.//You wouldn’t be able to sleep or do anything anyway. It’s way too loud.
130_Text=The beach cleanup is on the twenty-eighth, right?//<portrait=concerned>Umm… I think.
105_Text=The beach in Summer brings back childhood memories.//Eating corn on the cob at sunset was the best Summer treat back in the day.
40_Text=The fellowship with <NPCName>Ling</> doesn’t feel like work at all…//<portrait=happy>I’m glad she accepted my application.
100_Text=The hot spring near our house is sometimes visited by wildlife…like monkeys.//Especially in the colder seasons, like now. But I read somewhere that they go there to relax rather than to keep warm.//Their thick coats keep them plenty warm.
141_Text=The house smells wonderful lately because Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> has been busy testing recipes for the cooking competition.
98_Text=The lake is beautiful in Spring… Pink petals everywhere. But I prefer to swim in the ocean.//I kind of like the salty water. Is that weird? Ha ha.
35_Text=The mining site is in the very back of the forest, right across the river.
108_Text=The only time I truly feel at home here is when Summer hits and the heat rises. I guess I’m just a tropical boy at heart!
97_Text=The sakura trees usually only blossom for a two-week period… Two or three weeks, something like that.//It isn’t usually a whole-season thing, but it is here. Must be something special in the water.
106_Text=The water here stays warm in the evening…//It isn’t too cold to dive at night. In the Summer, though… I don’t know about any other season.
95_Text=The water’s starting to warm up.//<portrait=sad>But it’s still a bit too cold for me.
178_Text=The wind is so cold today.//I can literally feel it in my bones.
34_Text=Then I realized the cave was actually an old mining site.//<portrait=concerned>I dug out a couple of diamonds while I was there.//<portrait=normal>Do you know about this?
176_Text=There’s another scientist I’d like to do a fellowship under.//<portrait=concerned>But I don’t think he’s currently accepting applications.
102_Text=There’s nothing like going to the ocean on a hot Summer day.//Except for eating melon…
188_Text=They need to be stopped before it’s too late.
144_Text=They’re right. Time does fly when you’re having fun.
122_Text=This island is famous, huh? I’ve been noticing a lot of new people moving here lately.//<portrait=concerned>There was me… Then it was you, and now the Pufferfish Corp.
74_Text=Tomorrow is work as usual for me. Nope, nothing special planned that I remember.
131_Text=Uh… My mistake. I think it’s on the twenty-seventh.//<portrait=normal>I got it mixed up with the one back on Puny Island.
20_Text=Umm… Sure. Come over any time!//<portrait=concerned>I’m rarely home, though.
10_Text=Umm… Yeah?
93_Text=Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> is Dad’s brother. You’ve never met him, but they kind of look alike. I think I look like Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> a bit, no?
83_Text=Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> makes sure I don’t skip any festivals, because he doesn’t want me to miss all the fun.
129_Text=Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> tells me festivals are great way to meet everybody, especially since I’m new around here.
184_Text=Watching Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</> and Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> in their workshop is amazing. They create so many things.
199_Text=We have so many exciting projects going on in the lab! Stop by sometime, and I’ll show you around.
101_Text=We should be able to see seals chilling at the beach this time of year.//Some are shedding their old coats, and some are there to get away from predators.//That’s what I read online anyway.
133_Text=We turn it into materials for the town to use to fix community buildings or broken pavements.
31_Text=We’re moving toward the same goal, to make Coral Island home.//<portrait=happy>Yeah, you and me. We both want the same thing.
233_Text=What a beautiful day for a swim!
46_Text=Why am I here chilling when I could be in the lab finishing up reports?
164_Text=Why are you still here? Umm…
209_Text=Why did I tell you?
128_Text=Wow, that felt gossipy. Heh!
77_Text=You know, the usual stuff. You should come out! It’ll be fun.
19_Text=You lilve at the large farm by the forest? No way!//<portrait=happy>Beautiful spot. I actually live next to the forest as well.//<portrait=normal>At my Uncle <NPCName>Joko</> and Aunt <NPCName>Dinda</>'s house…

6_Text=Are you here to enjoy the Spring blooms?
2_Text=Haven't seen you before. Are you new here?
8_Text=I need to wash the hotspring sigh by the observatory.//<portrait=happy>It's been awhile since I did that. Last Summer, I think.
13_Text=I see...no need to worry. That's <NPCName>Taro</>.//He's carried away with his work and forgot about his friends.
4_Text=I've been eating the same lunch for years.//<portrait=happy>Oven-baked risotto is a great, comfort food.
1_Text=Is that you, <NPCName>Taro</>?//<portrait=annoyed>Oh...
14_Text=It's hard to find bamboo shoot right now. They're not sprouting yet...the ground is still too cold for them.
16_Text=It's pouring today.
7_Text=Not many visitors at the hotsrping in Summer.//I'm not surprised, but I wish more people would come and visit.
5_Text=Take your shoes off before going to bed, <NPCName>Taro</>.//<portrait=concerned>You don't want dirt on your blanket.
10_Text=Thank you for visiting...you and the young folks from the village.//Old man like me gets lonely sometimes.
9_Text=The leaves are piling up.//<portrait=surprised>How are the visitors going to bathe if they can't get past the entrance?
11_Text=The wind gets very strong lately. I think Summer is over.
3_Text=You're welcome to bathe at the hotspring. It's open for public.//You don't need to pay to enter.

103_Text=And I’ll open the festival with a song of my own.//<portrait=happy>Drives the crowds wild.

150_Text=Any song requests, <PlayerName>$player</>?
29_Text=Anyone can catch legendary fish at sea with the proper skill.//<portrait=normal>They’re hard to find, but not impossible.
93_Text=Are you looking forward to the New Year’s Eve Festival, <PlayerName>$player</>? There’s usually a lot of good food and fun games!//I’ll be singing too… Got some new tunes here in the brain!
46_Text=Dad is a fisherman, but he doesn’t fish so much anymore.//<portrait=concerned>Too old for the night wind, he says.
92_Text=Didn’t catch a lot of fish today, but I still managed to catch a yellowfin tuna. Must be Winter!
170_Text=Do you think anyone’s read all these books?
72_Text=Doesn’t all this new life make you feel inspired, <PlayerName>$player</>? The birth of new creatures also means the birth of new ideas.
108_Text=Either that, or I’m developing a pollen allergy. Hmm…
64_Text=Feeeeeeeel it, <PlayerName>$player</>.
70_Text=Flowers~ You beautiful flowers~ As beauuuuutiful as the eyes of my love~
54_Text=For a while I tried making a living as a truck driver, but it can get pretty lonely on the road.
125_Text=Growing up, I knew some people who had a lot more than we did, but they weren’t nearly half as happy.
84_Text=Ha! Never really realized how glowing you look in the Summer heat.//It suits you.
120_Text=Happy harvest season, farmer <PlayerName>$player</>!
47_Text=He helps <NpcName>Sunny</> run the beach shack full time now.
24_Text=Heh heh… Kidding. It doesn’t, I’m just messing with you.//<portrait=normal>But there are wild animals around here, so they might be responsible for any weird noises the townies hear.
146_Text=Hmm… Doesn’t ring a bell.//<portrait=annoyed>You sure you got the melody right?
126_Text=I almost slipped on the ice this morning. You be careful out there, <PlayerName>$player</>!
158_Text=I already delivered some of my catch to the beach shack.//I’m hoping to catch a bit more before the day ends.
166_Text=I always used to feel like I was waiting for something. Without knowing what it was.//<portrait=sad>It felt like torture.
26_Text=I am who I am, and there’s nothing wrong with that.//<portrait=happy>People may call me boring, but I know myself better.//<portrait=normal>I’m not boring or unmotivated… I’m laid back.
77_Text=I caught a tuna the other day, so I guess we’re entering Summer now.
161_Text=I come here whenever I feel like things are a bit overwhelming.//<portrait=normal>But I also come sometimes just to share something about my day.//Sometimes a little company is all we need.
112_Text=I could really go for some ice cream right now.
20_Text=I don’t have a favorite kind of music. I like any song that’s made with love.//When I’m listening, all I hear is the love the creator put in.
123_Text=I don’t know how I feel about that. It just seems… Cold.
85_Text=I don’t know why all the songs I’m writing are super sad lately. Here’s what I wrote yesterday.
117_Text=I don’t pay much attention to the calendar. Too constricting.//I usually notice the seasons changing by the type of fish I catch.
129_Text=I don’t travel a lot. Like, travel for leisure, you know. But I’ve gone places for work, and I’ve seen things.
130_Text=I guess being away for too long from my family is just not for me.
55_Text=I guess being away from family for too long just isn’t for me.//<portrait=normal>The pay was good, though.
153_Text=I had a really filling super meal that <NpcName>Frank</> made yesterday.//<portrait=normal>I don’t know if there’s any left, but you should try it if you can.
28_Text=I have no idea why I’m telling you all this. It’s like I had no choice but to say those things.//<portrait=angry>Weird.
100_Text=I hope this new year gives you a chance for a fresh start, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Whether that means taking another run at your goals, or maybe setting some new ones.
171_Text=I hope you didn’t come here looking for a song, because I’m not here to sing.
23_Text=I live with my sister and dad by the lake and it gets spooky at night.
56_Text=I met all sorts of folks on the road.//<portrait=happy>This one time, I met this guy with a really thick mustache, and he had a talking hat.//<portrait=normal>Nothing magic about it though, it was a robot that he built.
9_Text=I might try my hand at gardening one of these days.//<portrait=happy>I bet it’s a great outlet for self-expression.//<portrait=normal>All I need is a little piece of land and some seeds from <NpcName>Sam</>.
34_Text=I really appreciate <NpcName>Betty</> for taking it into her own hands to feed the wild birds.
14_Text=I refuse to pay for one of those shallow classes.//<portrait=angry>They don’t teach you how to really express yourself. They only teach you how to make pretty noises.
79_Text=I see seals, turtles, all kinds of wild animals swimming to shore in the Summer.//I talk to them too sometimes, for fun.
59_Text=I should pick up some greens for the fridge. Hmm…
33_Text=I sing live on weekends.//<portrait=happy>I don’t make much, but I can always use the tips.
157_Text=I sing to soothe my soul. Hopefully, it has the same effect on anyone else who hears it.
27_Text=I think we owe it to ourselves to be happy.//And the only key to happiness is being content with what you’ve got.
25_Text=I used to be nervous about the whole not-having-an-office-job thing or not going the traditional route, like my sister did.//Not anymore, though.
156_Text=I went to the lookout the other day and saw your farm. You’ve done a great job with it, <PlayerName>$player</>!
89_Text=I woke up today, and I didn’t feel too good. Then I looked at the calendar.//This is the week when we lost Mom…
82_Text=I wouldn’t sail too far if I were you.//Not in this heat. You might run into a storm at sea… Not saying you would.
15_Text=In this day and age, people can be so greedy.//We always want more, and more, and more.//<portrait=sad>It’s sad, really.
95_Text=Is it too cold to eat ice cream? Maybe, but I certainly wouldn’t say no if somebody offered me one!
94_Text=It can be dangerous to go out on the ocean in Winter, but if you’re trained and you’re careful, everything should turn out fine.
147_Text=It gets dark so early lately.
144_Text=It gets dark so fast in the Winter.
8_Text=It goes: Who were you~ Plastic bottle~ Where did you come frooooom~ A lump of trash~ Doooo doo doo doooo doodoooo~
102_Text=It’s a bit of tradition that I bring fresh fish to the Cherry Blossom Festival.//<portrait=happy>My dad would always bring his smoked salmon.
115_Text=It’s a pity, really. But hopefully, it’ll get better and better every day.
49_Text=It’s great to see you out and about!//<portrait=normal>Living on a big farm can be quite isolating.
162_Text=It’s hard to break a habit. But I’m taking it one day at a time.//With the right support system, I believe that any of us can do it.
172_Text=It’s just raining so hard outside, so…//Um… What was your question?
76_Text=It’s so much nicer to go out there and fish now.//I don’t have to stand in the freezing cold anymore.
136_Text=I’m a bit chilly, might need to put on a coat.
148_Text=I’m in the mood for something crunchy.
99_Text=I’m just glad that people are seeing the potential in this island.
73_Text=I’m looking forward to the Cherry Blossom Festival.//I’ve got a couple of new songs I want to play.
164_Text=I’m lucky I got out when I could.//<portrait=sad>I didn’t know what would happen to my family or me if I…
91_Text=I’m not a big fan of Fall.//I don’t hate it… It’s all right.
31_Text=I’m not actively hunting for legendary fish.//I don’t see the appeal.
58_Text=I’m not in the mood for pasta tonight, but I suppose it’s all we’ve got.//<portrait=sad><NPCName>Lily</>’s too busy to run to the store and I keep forgetting.
87_Text=I’m still singing and writing songs, but it’s harder for me to do in Fall.
113_Text=I’m taking a beach clean-up day off so I can participate.
114_Text=I’ve been bringing in more trash fishing than usual. Have you noticed that too?
67_Text=Laaa… laaa~ Coral reefs… Coral coral reefs~ Deep in blue sea… You’re old and pretty~ Laaaa~//<portrait=blushing>What do you think? Not bad, huh?
16_Text=Let me tell you something I learned, <PlayerName>$player</>.//Happy people are happy ’cause happiness comes from within, not from the endless pursuit of wealth.
118_Text=Let’s see what I can come up with for a Fall song.
97_Text=Like what? Hmm…let’s see. Rainbow fish aren’t Winter fish. They’re Fall.//Cobia too, I think.
128_Text=Making peace with myself was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.//Now I take every day as it comes, with an extra dose of gratitude.
17_Text=Maybe I will buy a new boat someday. But even then, it won’t be the new boat that makes me happy.//<portrait=happy>Fishing makes me happy.
2_Text=Me? I’m from here. I fish for a living.
159_Text=Meh, fishing during the day is enough for me.//<portrait=normal>I don’t need to fish at night too.
124_Text=Money was never really a thing for me. My dad was a fisherman his whole life, and Mom was a diver.//We had a pretty great life overall.
138_Text=My boat is not the most reliable in the rain, so I better stick to fishing on sunny days.
43_Text=My sister is right, it isn’t about us not being independent…//Living at home is a tradition in our family, it’s been like that for generations.
107_Text=My throat feels scratchy…//<portrait=sad>Must have been from eating too many banana fritters last night.
44_Text=My uncles and aunts all lived at home until they were married.
62_Text=Never mind, then…//My sister was upset the other day because she said that somebody was trying to buy her affection.//She was given a diamond and kind of lost it. Poor thing.
81_Text=Nice cold milk sounds good…but I probably shouldn’t.//It upsets my stomach, and my day’s just begun.
110_Text=Not today, though. Maybe when the water is a bit cooler.
163_Text=Nothing in this world is easy, <PlayerName>$player</>.//But taking it step by step helps a lot!
167_Text=Now I’m not waiting anymore.//<portrait=happy>I’m living…
12_Text=Now is not the time…//<portrait=happy>Before I get started, I’m waiting for my calling to farm.//<portrait=normal>Won’t be too long… I can feel it coming on soon.
1_Text=Oh yeah, yeah! I heard about you.//You’re that new farmer from San Franciskyo, right?//<portrait=normal>Ah, that’s right! POKYO.//I’m <NPCName>Theo</>.
19_Text=Oh! I forgot!//<portrait=concerned>I’m meeting my friends at the community center today.//<portrait=sad>Oh, no no. Hang on. That’s tomorrow!
69_Text=Oh, <PlayerName>$player</>, want to hear my new song? I wrote it yesterday.
105_Text=Oh, I’m happy singing here, <PlayerName>$player</>.//I don’t need some fancy label to tell me how to live.
13_Text=Oh, can you really tell?!//<portrait=happy>Yeah, both my guitar and singing skills are self-taught.
121_Text=Oh, hang on… I have fall melodies coming into my mind. Dum~ Dum~
66_Text=Oh, like what? Hmm… Let’s see.//<portrait=happy><NPCName>Lily</> loves pancakes, omurice… Hmm… What else?
61_Text=Oh, since I have you here… I have something to ask.//Did you by any chance give my sister a diamond?//<portrait=annoyed>It wasn’t you, was it?
142_Text=One of my favorite things about Winter is all the festive decorations. It makes the town feel so alive.
109_Text=One of these days, I’ll go fishing at your farm.//I‘m curious to survey the area and see what kinds of fish swim there.
7_Text=One time, I was walking past the recycling center when inspiration struck.//<portrait=concerned>What can I do to help? My heart was set, and that was it.//<portrait=happy>I stopped and hung out there for two days, writing a song about recyclables.
154_Text=Oy, <NpcName>Frank</>! Make one of those super meals for <PlayerName>$player</>, will ya?
60_Text=Should I go to Sam’s, or should I just run to the woodlands real quick?
122_Text=Singing in the rain? Now that is an idea.
96_Text=Some fish don’t stick around in Winter. They go… They swim away to warmer waters.
90_Text=Summer was cool. I caught plenty of tuna. The Beach Shack was pretty happy…//Today is a different story.
169_Text=Sure are a lot of books in here…
78_Text=The Summer breeze feels different on my face… A little saltier than Spring, if you want to know.
22_Text=The beach and the sea are my favorite places.//It’s so peaceful, isn’t it? The sea shelters millions of lives, yet it remains so humble.
116_Text=The change in the season never really bothers me. I still fish… I still sing.
80_Text=The heat’s getting to me, <PlayerName>$player</>. Should I go for a swim?//I might if you will too…
75_Text=The island is so alive with music, <PlayerName>$player</>.//The crashing of the waves, the chirping of the birds, and even the rustling of the new leaves come together to make this beautiful Spring music.
63_Text=The thing about playing the guitar is that you have to feel it in your gut first.//<portrait=normal>Then it will flow out through the melody.
6_Text=There are so many microplastics at sea.//<portrait=annoyed>You’d be surprised how much trash I can gather in just one day out fishing.
57_Text=There’s a song in there. I can feel it!
151_Text=This gig isn’t really banking the big bucks for me. But it isn’t always about the money, ya know?//<portrait=happy>It’s about doing something that you love.
71_Text=This is usually the season when a lot of fish eggs hatch.//I had to release a lot back to the ocean the other day because they were too small.
137_Text=This place has that damp aura about it, and the rain makes it worse.
106_Text=Today I wanna focus on my soul and just feed my brain some thoughts.
18_Text=We need to take time to know ourselves.//That’s the only way to find out what we really enjoy, without pressure from other people.
48_Text=Wealth isn’t everything, <PlayerName>$player</>. Don’t waste your life chasing it.
21_Text=What about you? What’s your favorite music genre?
32_Text=What are you gonna do this weekend?
145_Text=What if I write a song about winter and cheerful bells?//<portrait=happy>Bells jingling and people singing along and laughing.
111_Text=Why do I feel like there’s a new bug in town every Summer?
74_Text=You hear that, <PlayerName>$player</>? I only wish I could sing as great as the birds. So carefree and beautiful.
88_Text=You know how I know it’s Fall? I caught plenty of cod yesterday!
160_Text=You’re welcome to join the meeting here, <PlayerName>$player</>…//<portrait=normal>No pressure.
86_Text=“The lifeless leaves have left my life.” What a downer.
68_Text=… You’re leaving me hanging here, bud…
106_Text=*thunder clap* Aaaaa!
99_Text=*whispering* Rain, rain, let’s come and play~//The day will be plain without puddles to play~
103_Text=*yawns* Aww, I wish I could stay up and watch the rain, but it makes me really sleepy…//<portrait=sad>Humph… I should probably go to bed.
71_Text=<NPCName>Archie</> says he wants to be a vet and take care of sick animals when he grows up.//I think that’s a great idea.
95_Text=<NPCName>Bree</> is okay with it.
51_Text=<NPCName>Dinda</> taught us how to make kites. She's my friend's mom and she's pretty cool.//She came to school on Career Day to talk about carpentry.
6_Text=<NPCName>Emma</> makes really good fish tacos!//Sometimes she comes to our class and just hands them out to us for free.
41_Text=<NPCName>Taco</> used to live with us at the inn, but he moved to Hillside Vineyard.
49_Text=<NPCName>Taco</> used to live with us at the inn, but he moved to Hillside.
28_Text=<NPCName>Yuri</> is my favorite doctor. She’s supercool.//<portrait=annoyed>But when I have the tiniest cold, she’s always like, “No surfing too long.” No this, no that…
84_Text=<NPCName>Yuri</> says I’m sensitive to pollen, just like <NPCName>Charles</>.
119_Text=But I also want to be like Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</>. He teaches kids like me and grades projects.
80_Text=But I kind of want to, you know.
54_Text=But when it’s festival time, he takes a day off to play with me for the whole day!//<portrait=normal>Pretty cool, huh?
104_Text=Good night…
77_Text=Have you checked out the new mini golf?
10_Text=He also said sometimes adults aren’t sure about what they want to be either.//And that’s okay…
1_Text=Hello, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>… Nice to meet you too. I’m <NPCName>Valentina</>.
108_Text=Hey, do you know one of the many, many reasons I love rain?//<portrait=normal>Because at school, we get to stay inside and play.
101_Text=Hey, do you know one of the many, many reasons I love rain?//Because at school, we get to stay inside and play.
129_Text=Hmmm… Where is it…
26_Text=I believe him. He’s a truth-teller, you know.
131_Text=I brought some lunch with me, so I don’t have to go home so soon.
46_Text=I can only go to the forest when I go with an adult, like Aunt <NPCName>Alice</>, or when <NPCName>Archie</> asks his dad to go with us.
21_Text=I don’t like visiting my uncles in their shop. It’s too hot and loud in there…//<portrait=sad>But dad says sometimes we have to visit them to show we care.
123_Text=I don’t understand why, because Aunt <NPCName>Alice</> is the one who always brings it over anyway…//It’s not like Mom’s going back and forth.
76_Text=I don’t understand. So Pufferfish is coming to Coral Island to buy houses?
36_Text=I get to play volleyball with Uncle <NPCName>Rafael</> when he comes to visit.//<portrait=happy>He’s not good at it, but that’s okay because it means I always win.
59_Text=I guess… I play on the beach a lot after school because I live there. I don’t think Mom would let me go anywhere else on weekdays.
40_Text=I have fourteen people on my list so far.
115_Text=I hope it’s piling up really fast so there’s enough for <NPCName>Ollie</>, <NPCName>Archie</>, and me to make a snowman.
111_Text=I hope there’s enough for <NPCName>Oliver</>, <NPCName>Archie</>, and me to make a snowman.
52_Text=I learned a lot about trees, cutting wood, and making things that day.
8_Text=I like cats. They’re so cute and fluffy.//<portrait=happy>Especially when they purr…
98_Text=I like pies too, but only the pumpkin kind…
85_Text=I like to be outside with the bugs.
13_Text=I like to wear my hair down. Just like my mom!//<portrait=normal>And Aunt <NPCName>Alice</> too.
45_Text=I need to be careful about what I bring back from the forest, because there are poisonous mushrooms there.
128_Text=I need to find Mom’s extra scarf for my snowman.
17_Text=I play at the beach most of the weekend, but that’s not all!//I also like to go to the library with <NPCName>Archie</>.//His mom says the beach is too far for him, so we can only play in Starlet Town.
5_Text=I play at the beach with <NPCName>Oliver</> after school.//<portrait=happy>So much fun!//<portrait=normal>But then, we get hungry after a while, so we go home.
4_Text=I saw Uncle <NPCName>Rafael</> yesterday. He came to visit us at the inn.//<portrait=annoyed>Every time I see him, he always asks me about school… Like every week!
38_Text=I usually finish my reading on Saturday.//That way, I can play all day on Sunday.
136_Text=I wanna play with the cats…//<portrait=doubt>But they don’t go out very much.
70_Text=I wish I had a twin, just like Mom and Aunt <NPCName>Alice</>… That would be double awesome. We could play all day and get a double amount of snacks.
69_Text=I wonder what Mom’s cooking for dinner tonight. I sure hope it isn’t edamame again.
120_Text=If <NPCName>Oliver</>'s up for it, I think we might play some volleyball after school.
135_Text=If you have an extra Winter hat, you can put it on your snowman to make it fancy!
39_Text=It’s hard to remember birthdays, so I keep a list of my friends’ birthdays in my room.
121_Text=It’s no fun playing volleyball alone.
60_Text=It’s not very safe for me to explore after dark. So I have to be home before dinner.
78_Text=It’s right next to <NPCName>Lily</>'s house!
63_Text=I’m allowed to play after school as long as I get my reading done.
14_Text=I’m allowed to stay up until ten sometimes.//<portrait=doubt>But not too often, because Mom and Dad say I’m cranky in the morning if I stay up too late.
88_Text=I’m cold.
74_Text=I’m kinda small right now, but I’m eating my vegetables and keeping active, so I’m on my way to becoming big and strong.
11_Text=I’m never cutting my hair.//I’m gonna grow it really long like Mom’s.
20_Text=Living at the inn is awesome.//You get to meet so many nice people!
122_Text=Mom gets pretty upset when I forget my lunch at home.
37_Text=Mom makes green smoothies, and five minutes later, she forgets about it.//And then she goes and makes another one…
50_Text=Mom said Hillside Vineyard is better for <NPCName>Taco</>, because he can run around and play with other animals.
29_Text=Mom says coffee keeps you up at night, and too much gives you a headache.
81_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> always has fun things for us to do.
64_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> doesn’t really give us homework anyway. So I usually just watch TV or play with my toys after dinner.
9_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> said we don’t need to know what we wanna be when we grow up yet.
18_Text=Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</>'s prosnetic arm is the coolest thing in the world!//<portrait=happy>It makes him look like a superhero’s villain.
43_Text=My dad can only visit after work, so he usually gets here late at night and on weekends.
53_Text=My dad can only visit after work, so he usually gets here late at night.
25_Text=My dad says I surf better than he does, and if I keep practicing, I might just be the best surfer in the whole world!
12_Text=My mom always packs my lunch for school.//<portrait=doubt>She says lunch first, snacks second… Oh, well.
93_Text=My mom lets me go to <NPCName>Bree</>'s early on the twenty-eighth to play with <NPCName>Taco</> and <NPCName>Archie</>.
79_Text=My mom said I don’t have to bring anything yet for the Cherry Blossom Festival.
83_Text=My nose is itchy.
30_Text=My parents say we shouldn’t talk to strangers… Um…
24_Text=No, I don’t want any.
100_Text=Oh! I didn’t see you there, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>!//I was just singing my rain song to get it to rain more.
90_Text=Oh, finally! I get to dress up snowmen now and not just scarecrows.
109_Text=Oh, sorry. I’m afraid of thunder. Gotta go.
107_Text=Oh, sorry. I’m afraid of thunder. I bet you’re not afraid of anything.//I mean, you live on a farm, and you make your own food!
137_Text=Oh, they live over there. At the house behind the welcome sign.
133_Text=Oh, you too?//<portrait=happy>I'm not surprised. You kinda smell like one too.//It's a good thing! I wish I smelled like bugs.
22_Text=On the weekend, you can see <NPCName>Taco</> chilling at the town center.
19_Text=Press…tethic… Umm…
96_Text=Psst… My mom’s and Aunt <NPCName>Alice</>'s birthdays are coming up on the twenty-seventh.
92_Text=She helps Mr. <NPCName>Barnes</> a lot with our school projects and knows a lot of good books.
7_Text=She taught us how to make fish tacos, but Mom already taught me first.//So I didn’t learn anything new.
89_Text=Snowman season! Yay!
3_Text=Sometimes school is boring.//<portrait=annoyed>You read all these hard books all the time. Blech!
118_Text=Sometimes, I want to be a scientist like <NPCName>Ling</>…//<portrait=normal>So I can have my own lab and study whatever I want and tell people about it.
126_Text=The inn is too far away for <NPCName>Archie</>, so we meet up here to read the new comic books.
86_Text=There are more seashells at the beach in Summer, by the way…
97_Text=They both love minced jackfruit pies, so I asked <NPCName>Archie</>'s mom to help me bake some as a surprise.
23_Text=This one time, my mom made ice cream from tofu.//<portrait=sad>It was NOT good.
82_Text=This one time, we went to visit <NPCName>Jack</> at his ranch, and we got to learn about animal farming the whole day.
91_Text=Tomorrow is <NPCName>Millie</>'s birthday… She’s the one who works at the library.
127_Text=Umm… <NPCName>Millie</> gives us cookies and milk sometimes too.
31_Text=Umm… I don’t have anything to say.
87_Text=Umm… Or at least, it feels like it, anyway. I seem to be collecting more lately.
2_Text=Umm… Yeah, it’s really fun here.//<portrait=happy>You get to fly kites and build snowmen in Winter!
75_Text=Umm… Yup.
94_Text=We also get to pretend to be farmers! <NPCName>Archie</> and I get to water the vines and pick grapes.
130_Text=We borrow books from the library for guests to read.//I help Aunt <NPCName>Alice</> by taking them back on the weekends when I meet <NPCName>Archie</>.
35_Text=We don’t have any homework. We only have a weekend reading assignment.
27_Text=When I’d ask <NPCName>Yuri</> about one of her tattoos, she’d tell me superlong stories.//<portrait=happy>And then at the end, she’d yell “Psych!” really loud… She’s so funny!
116_Text=Yay! It’s snowing.
110_Text=Yay! It’s snowing. I can’t wait to see how deep the snow is tomorrow.
134_Text=You need to make sure the head of the snowman is a smaller ball than the body.
66_Text=You’re not small, <PlayerName>$honorifics $player</>! Someday, I’m going to be big and strong too.
117_Text=[<NPCName>Valentina</> is busy studying.]
22_Text=<PlayerName>$player</>! I’ll be at the Tavern tonight, playing pool with the gang. You should join us!

110_Text=Wearing loose clothing is the way to go.//Gotta give your body room to breathe… Not sandals, though.//<portrait=happy>I can’t run in those.
140_Text=We’re cleaning up the beach soon.
126_Text=We’re stocked up with a lot of cold medicine this season.//The weather is dry and cold… Exactly how viruses like it.
194_Text=What am I going to do there, anyway?//It’s not like I could just start mining or something.
119_Text=What is it they say about Fall? Sweater weather?//<portrait=normal>Yeah, I think that’s right.
123_Text=When I was traveling around the world, most of the places I was dispatched to were really hot.//<portrait=happy>I gotta say, it’s so nice to finally stay put somewhere with Winter.
70_Text=When I was younger, I worked for universal doctor programs around the world.//It’s a program that sends medical professionals to foreign places to provide medical assistance.
182_Text=Whenever I can, basically. Dancing is an instant mood-booster.//<portrait=happy>Hey, we should go dancing together sometime.
53_Text=Who knows…
112_Text=Will you be entering the swimming contest?
125_Text=Winter is usually our busiest season. People tend to get sick…which is why I prefer to get my flu vaccination in Fall.//To prepare for this.
148_Text=With the weather getting colder, I see fewer and fewer people outside.//<portrait=annoyed>Do you notice that too?
33_Text=Yeah! Fishing totally teaches patience.
133_Text=You can get tulip, wasabi, and celery this time of year.//<portrait=annoyed>Hmm… What else?
177_Text=You know, like <NPCName>Charles</>. He looks good in his coat.
167_Text=You’d think it would’ve stopped by now.
96_Text=You’ve seen me where?!
239_Text=<NPCName>Sam</> offered me some leftover roasted nuts the other day. It was nice of him, but I turned them down.//<portrait=annoyed>Eating nuts is like chewing on wood.
92_Text=A client once wanted me to search for a chalice in the dead of Winter.//<portrait=annoyed>I said no way, unless he was willing to pay me ten times my usual rate.//<portrait=happy>He gladly waited until Spring.
232_Text=A life in Pokyo… Interesting! We gotta swap stories sometimes. You look like you have cool ones to share.
63_Text=A little tip from one treasure hunter to another.
1_Text=A new farmer in town?//You moved here <Italic>after</> the oil spill? Huh.//<portrait=normal>I’m <NPCName>Zarah</>. //See you around.
50_Text=A raccoon, you say? Not convinced. A raccoon would’ve eaten it, I’d think.
116_Text=Ah! What’s that like? I feel like we’re all in a big simulation game sometimes.
31_Text=Ah, I don’t know. Doesn’t sound very convenient.
114_Text=Ah, I see.
257_Text=All this snow on the ground means buried treasure is harder to find. It’s no fun to dig through wet snow, either.
70_Text=Are you ready for the start of a new year, <PlayerName>$player</>? I know I’m raring to go.
263_Text=As an adventurer, I’m okay with getting dirty, grimy, dusty, and everything else…but I still hate getting wet.
259_Text=As much as I love my boat, I feel a little trapped during Winter.//I don’t want to stay inside, but I don’t want to go out into the cold air, either.
286_Text=As much as I love the water, sometimes it’s nice to see some green, too.//<portrait=normal>Coral Island has so many different environments!
179_Text=At first, I thought you were…//<portrait=surprised>A bear or something.
177_Text=But maybe we can chat again sometime?//<portrait=annoyed>Now just isn’t a good time.
108_Text=But there are plenty of wild vegetables growing.//This is a good thing for someone like me, who relies on nature a lot for food.
11_Text=Camping in a cavern for more than two days is a nasty business. I don’t miss it.//<portrait=annoyed>How can a place be damp and hot at the same time?
36_Text=Cooked plenty of food yesterday.//I don’t think I’ll need to make any more until tomorrow.//But I am craving some grilled fish.
247_Text=Coral Island is always beautiful this time of year.//<portrait=normal>It’s beautiful year-round, but it really blooms in the Spring.
87_Text=Daylight is getting shorter and shorter. Looks like I’ll have to stop my exploration pretty soon.
237_Text=Did you know Coral Island’s ecosystem has changed a lot in the past several hundred years?//<portrait=normal>There are a lot of old fossils around here that tell the story. It’s so interesting!
81_Text=Do you ever find random crabs on your farm?//<portrait=thinking>The rice field <Italic>right</> behind your farm is full of them… This time of year, anyway.//<portrait=normal>Pretty much all I caught the last time I fished there.
26_Text=Do you think it’s up to us to find out about these hidden mysteries?//Or is it our duty to wait until nature is ready to open up?
21_Text=Do you think it’s up to us to find out?//Or is it our duty to wait until nature is ready to show us?
249_Text=Do you think we’ll get any storms soon, <PlayerName>$player</>?//I’d rather know ahead of time if they’re coming.
195_Text=Do you think you could ever live on a boat?
115_Special=Does studying count? I was a student. In a way, still am.
99_Text=Don’t make the same mistake I did, <PlayerName>$player</>…//Pack some food.
199_Text=Don’t mind the mess. I need to keep things where they are, or I wouldn’t be able to find my stuff.
48_Text=Don’t worry about it! I’m sure it’s because I’m away a lot. I rarely spend much time on the boat.
244_Text=Even though the air is warmer now, the ocean is still very cold. I wouldn’t want to dive off the deck of my boat quite yet.
268_Text=Even when I’m safely inside for the night, I can still feel the rain hitting the deck and the roll of the waves outside.//At least it’s not too windy.
221_Text=Excuse me! I’m so sorry, <PlayerName>$player</>.//My nose is acting up.
39_Text=Exhibit A: Just this morning, I found a fresh loaf of bread outside my boat. I wonder who left it there.
253_Text=Feel that chill in the air? Winter’s on its way, <PlayerName>$player</>.
91_Text=Fished a little the other day and caught a green sawfish.//<portrait=normal>Have you tried catching them? You should, since they only come out in wintertime. I caught it right outside your farm… You know where that giant tree is? It was in the body of water across from the hot-air balloon area.//I’d try in the evening. I think they hide during the day.
201_Text=For my last job, I lived outdoors almost a whole year.
7_Text=Going on an adventure, <PlayerName>$player</>?
269_Text=Going somewhere?
255_Text=Grilled fish are delicious this time of year. I catch them from my boat and cook them myself.
154_Text=Ha ha! Is it weird?
241_Text=Ha! That’s okay. I wouldn’t say I’m a hermit.//<portrait=happy>It’s more like knowing who I am, what I like and dislike and sticking with it.
95_Text=Have you ever fished near the mayor’s house in Winter?//I heard from the young fisherman you can catch silver arowana there.//<portrait=thinking>Long black hair? Yeah, that’s the one.//<portrait=happy>Oh, the one with bright-red boots, not the one with glasses. She’s not a fisher, I don’t think.//<portrait=thinking>But I don’t really know… Never see her around much.
102_Text=Have you met <NPCName>Scott</>?//I see him at the cavern every now and then.
90_Text=Have you tried tilling the soil on your farm? You might find some stuff…//<portrait=thinking>Oh, but it’s pretty much ice right now, huh?
251_Text=Having a Summer birthday isn’t too bad. It means I get extra hours of daylight to celebrate.
101_Text=He moved here just before you did.//<portrait=normal>Heard it was for coral reef restoration. He’s some sort of doctor, I believe; not the medical kind.
279_Text=Hey, <PlayerName>$player</>. Did you come to see me or my boat?
5_Text=How was your weekend?//I had a good one; thanks for asking.
193_Text=I bought this boat with the payment I got for helping a rich family retrieve a lost heirloom.
58_Text=I can play with cats now, but I still sneeze here and there… It’s not bad at all, though.
289_Text=I can see why people love the ocean so much.//The constant roll of the waves, the rainbow of the sunlight on the water… It’s beautiful.
68_Text=I can’t wait for the Cherry Blossom Festival. There’s going to be a lot of good food.//And people. Not a bad thing, actually.
149_Text=I caught some fish a little while ago.//<portrait=thinking>I think I’ll make soup with them for dinner.
161_Text=I caught some giant stingrays earlier.//It really has been a productive day for me.
98_Text=I could NOT have been more wrong. There was hardly any food, and I ran out of energy in the middle of a battle.//<portrait=annoyed>I passed out and was found by a local blacksmith.
296_Text=I could buy lots of rare gems and artifacts if I wanted to, but it’s not the same as finding them myself.//They feel more valuable when I put in the effort.
191_Text=I didn’t hear you knock. Umm…
295_Text=I didn’t think there would be so many people here.//<portrait=normal>I should probably head home.
225_Text=I don’t care what they’re worth.//They remind me of adventures I’ve been on.
236_Text=I don’t have a lot of time to read, but I like to pick up a history book now and again.
245_Text=I don’t know too much about farming, but I do know Spring is when you’re supposed to plant flowers.
246_Text=I don’t think I need flowers on my boat.//My gem collection is colorful enough.
254_Text=I feel closest to nature in Fall. The beautiful colors, piles of leaves on the ground… It’s something to be thankful for.
55_Text=I feel like we’re in this big game of life, and we’re fated to go on endless adventures.
216_Text=I found a beautiful vintage-looking gem on the beach the other day… Must be at least 100 years old.//I don’t think it belongs to anyone, so I’m going to add it to my collection. It’ll be a centerpiece!
15_Text=I found some scrolls when I was fishing the other day. Fishing!//<portrait=surprised02>Who would’ve thought?
119_Text=I gathered several coconuts near the inn the other day, and I haven’t touched them.//<portrait=thinking>What should I make with them? Hmm…
208_Text=I get a lot of questions about what I do. I’m an adventurer, plain and simple.
32_Text=I get why some people like to work alone…//<portrait=concerned>It’s nice to have an extra hand, but coordinating can be a pain.
188_Text=I guess you could say I live in town.//Sure doesn’t feel like it sometimes.
118_Text=I hate roasted nuts. Nuts are easy to find and simple to roast, but they taste like rotten charcoal.
125_Text=I have a love-hate relationship with cold weather. It makes me feel like I have endless energy. But at the same time, it’s harder to find wild vegetables.
173_Text=I have to say, I do like my space.//I mostly keep busy on the island, so it doesn’t leave me much time to socialize.
111_Text=I heard you worked in a big city before becoming a farmer.
273_Text=I just can’t stay focused on this book.
226_Text=I keep hearing stories about legendary treasures scattered all over the island.//It’s my job to investigate!
8_Text=I kind of like it here on Coral Island.//<portrait=happy>Who knows, maybe someday I’ll buy a house and move to a place that doesn’t rock…//<portrait=thinking>Sounds dull, to be honest.
106_Text=I learn something new every day on this island if I look closely enough.
174_Text=I learned these ruins have been here since the first human settlement.
261_Text=I like Coral Island too much to do that, though. I’ll just make sure to keep the heat on all the time.
171_Text=I like being able to hear people chatting.//<portrait=concerned>It makes it feel less lonely on the boat.
285_Text=I like to spend my days off here. It feels good to stretch my legs and sit under the sky.
267_Text=I like to think rain is nature’s way of telling us to take a break. It helps plants grow, provides water for animals, and pushes us humans inside.
277_Text=I like watching the snow melt as it hits the ocean. It just piles up if it lands on my boat.
116_Special=I made games. It’s really fun, but it’s not as easy as I thought it was going to be.
152_Text=I might as well make my day productive and fish for a bit. Right?
272_Text=I need to make sure, uh, my boat is okay. And that I’m okay, too.
204_Text=I never get to know a lot of people very well…// I don’t really mind it, though, because I tend to move around a lot anyway…//That said, I’m glad I’ve stayed long enough to get to know you.
64_Text=I once got into trouble with a client because he wanted his money back. The problem was the government took the treasure I found, and my client sued me for unfinished work.
44_Text=I see myself in <NPCName>Jim</> a lot. At times it makes me wonder if I’ll ever stop looking for new adventures and finally find satisfaction in life.
230_Text=I should have started earlier, but I had more exciting things to do.//Wouldn’t you rather hunt for buried treasure than clean?
30_Text=I should start leaving my boots by the door.//I bring so much mud into the boat.
75_Text=I spend a lot of time at the beach in Summer.//Anyway, why wouldn’t I?
59_Text=I spent a lot of time camping, and I’ve had my fair share of roasted chestnuts. It’s safe to say I’m a bit sick of them now. Yuck.
28_Text=I spent almost the whole day yesterday trying to find fresh vegetables, and I still came up short.
155_Text=I think I’ll head inside in a little bit and make myself a warm meal.
162_Text=I think I’m going to read a bit and call it a day.
234_Text=I think a cat got into my lunch yesterday somehow.//I ate my sandwich and sneezed a little.//Weird.
183_Text=I think it’s good for me to come here once in a while.//Besides, spending too much time on a small boat can get claustrophobic.
218_Text=I told them maybe. It’s probably better for living in than racing.
76_Text=I understand the Beach Cleanup Festival is really important, but do they have to do it all day?
57_Text=I used to have a bad allergy to cats.//<portrait=normal>But thankfully, I outgrew it.
153_Text=I want to keep close to my boat on rainy days like this.//<portrait=annoyed>Just in case the rain gets really strong and my boat gets swept away.
2_Text=I was sailing the other day, and you wouldn’t believe how much trash I saw at sea.//<portrait=annoyed>Hmm…
276_Text=I was supposed to go spelunking today, but I had to postpone it because of this snow. I guess I’ll just stay close to home for now.
284_Text=I wasn’t big on fishing before I moved here, but sometimes there’s not much else to do on the water besides catch a few trout.
97_Text=I went on an adventure to discover a buried temple one time and filled my bag with weapons and no food.//<portrait=normal>I thought there’d be food for me wherever I went. Being not picky and all.
264_Text=I wish I could stick around and talk, but I want to stay as dry as possible.
6_Text=I woke up unmotivated this morning. It’s one of those days, I guess.
223_Text=I wonder if there are shipwrecks down there… I bet there’s treasure!
219_Text=I wonder what civilizations were here before us.//What was happening hundreds of years ago on this very spot?
250_Text=If a storm’s coming, I have to prep my boat… It’s a long process.
43_Text=If it weren’t for the talk around town, you’d never know <NPCName>Jim</> is a very skillful fisher. He doesn’t fish much anymore and doesn’t really talk about it.
207_Text=If you find anything on the island that looks really old, take it to the museum! It might be a rare artifact.
126_Text=If you haven’t noticed, the ruins and temples tell stories. They’re about the island’s history and folklore.
10_Text=If you're looking for a tip, I know a thing or two about combat.//<portrait=normal>For instance, you don’t want to go into combat without armor…//Common sense, yeah?
196_Text=It is fun! But I wouldn’t recommend it if you get seasick easily.
65_Text=It was a mess. My hands were tied, and I couldn’t do anything about it. Good thing it’s all behind me.
256_Text=It’s a good, warm meal for cold nights.
178_Text=It’s a nice surprise to see someone familiar here.
265_Text=It’s easy to slip when it’s dark and rainy like this, especially when you’re walking on a wet deck.//Be careful.
96_Text=It’s going to be one hot Summer, isn’t it?//I can already tell.
124_Text=It’s hard to get any warm sunlight lately. It’s making me feel a bit down.
73_Text=It’s nice that the sun is up longer, but… Never mind.
93_Text=It’s not just the cold that makes treasure hunting a pain in Winter. Soil is much harder to dig too… Pretty much concrete at this point.//Better to just wait until the ice melts.
77_Text=It’s pretty much Fall, and… Wait, no it isn’t.//<portrait=thinking>It’s still the second week of Summer… I thought it was the 20th already.
189_Text=It’s really nice to see you here!
160_Text=It’s too cold for me to sail.
3_Text=It’s upsetting to see nature being covered in trash like that.
203_Text=It’s very nice of you to visit!
67_Text=I’d have to say Spring and Fall are the best seasons to hunt for treasure. It isn’t too hot, and there’s enough daylight.
117_Special=I’d prefer to keep that to myself.
33_Text=I’d rather work alone as well…//During my own hours and by my own rules.
187_Text=I’m always on the lookout for a new adventure.//Look closer, <PlayerName>$player</>. This town is full of it.
69_Text=I’m impatient for Spring to get here. I have so many leads for where to find treasure. Maybe even too many.
85_Text=I’m looking forward to <NPCName>Betty’s</> mooncakes. It’s a shame she doesn’t make them more often.
129_Text=I’m making small changes on the boat.//<portrait=normal>I think it’s a bit tidier.
80_Text=I’m not saying you can only eat grilled fish in Fall. Grilled fish is top-tier food that can be enjoyed any time of day, any time of year.//<portrait=happy>But it’s so much better when the weather’s slightly frisky. Like in Fall.
184_Text=I’m supposed to go to the forest today, yet here we are.
34_Text=I’m thinking of putting a big, fun bell on the bow of my boat.//<portrait=happy>A bit like a doorbell for a house.
228_Text=I’ve always just thought of it as “mine.”
194_Text=I’ve basically lived here ever since.//<portrait=happy>Comfy, isn’t it?
79_Text=I’ve been catching a lot of groupers lately…//They’re…<Italic>not</> pretty. But all fish taste pretty much the same after you grill them.
103_Text=I’ve been collecting clues about this island’s secrets.//Though I put my mission off during Winter and decided to enjoy the weather instead. I can’t wait to get going again.//<portrait=happy>Now that it’s Spring, I shall continue my adventure.
86_Text=I’ve been having grilled fish for almost every meal for the past two weeks. I think I may have a problem.
287_Text=I’ve hunted for treasure around here before, but I don’t think there’s anything to find.
143_Text=Join me fishing, <PlayerName>$player</>?
18_Text=Life feels bland when I’m not after something…//<portrait=annoyed>Pity, really.
212_Text=Life moves more slowly out here. It’s nice not to have to stick to a work schedule, isn’t it?//Just how I like it.
170_Text=Living at the pier is great because it’s close to the store and to people.//It’s nice to know they’re right there.
215_Text=Living on a boat can be hard. Nature can turn on you in an instant… Be prepared, <PlayerName>$player</>.
280_Text=Living on a boat isn’t much different from living on land. I still have to make sure I have enough food, supplies, and medicine.
266_Text=Look at it pour out there. Do you think it’ll clear up soon?
278_Text=Looks like I’ll have shoveling to do tomorrow.
274_Text=Maybe I should just go to bed. I’m not going to get anything accomplished while the weather is this bad.
209_Text=Maybe being an adventurer is not the most conventional career out there.//I get why people are confused. Heh heh.//…is it even considered a career path, you think?Hmm…
29_Text=Maybe the lake is a better area for foraging… Hmm…
198_Special=Maybe. I don’t know. Why?
37_Text=Maybe… Maybe I can just grill one fish. That way, I won’t forget to eat my other food tomorrow.
23_Text=Maybe… Maybe after the town fixes the community garden, I’ll try my hand at growing something.
290_Text=Most people only visit the beach on vacation, but I get to live there.//I’m lucky.
25_Text=My thoughts? There may be more to this island than meets the eye.
198_Text=No reason.//Living on a boat can be fun, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you get seasick easily.
197_Special=No, I prefer a home on solid ground.
176_Text=Not now, <PlayerName>$player</>.
252_Text=Not that I do much celebrating, though.//That’s not really my style.
190_Text=Not that many people come to this side of town.//<portrait=happy>Most people like to visit the park instead.
233_Text=Not today…ha ha. Thanks, though!
66_Text=Now that Spring is here, I’m ready to search for treasure again.
123_Text=Oh! Do you feel that wind?
156_Text=Oh! Do you feel that?
168_Text=Oh, listen, listen. I tried docking my boat right behind your farm, but it got too quiet at night.//<portrait=happy>So I bailed. Doesn’t bother you, huh?
112_Text=Oh, that’s right! I heard about that.
9_Text=Oh, you’re the chatty type.//<portrait=normal>Don’t be insulted if I don’t say hi to you first, okay?// Probably, I either don’t see you or I’m too distracted to notice anything.
206_Text=On land, the breeze feels different from the way it does on the ocean. At sea, it feels…endless.
213_Text=On the other hand, a schedule gives you structure.//I guess there are good things and bad things about it.
224_Text=People always tell me my gem collection is worth a lot of money, but I would never sell any of my stones.
24_Text=Pro tip, <PlayerName>$player</>. Always bring a weapon in your bag.//Just in case you encounter nasty bugs.
167_Text=Right over there?
262_Text=Sam’s sells delicious cookies. I can never have enough of them.//Have you tried them?<lf>
180_Text=Should I move my boat here?
89_Text=Since I can’t spend a lot of time out there, I usually read up on the treasures I’m looking for.//The history, clues to their locations, things like that.
275_Text=Snow makes me just as soggy as rain does...like a stale chip.//...left too long in between the couches' cushions.
217_Text=Some kids on the island asked me if I’d ever use my boat for racing. I had a good laugh at that.
260_Text=Some people escape to Winter houses in warmer climates when it gets too cold. I suppose I could move my boat somewhere warmer in Winter.
235_Text=Some people say you can see strange things if you look closely at precious gems. I don’t think they can tell the future or anything like that, but they’re very pretty.
294_Text=Sometimes I wonder if I should have gotten a lake house instead of my boat.//I knew I wanted to be near water, but I wasn’t sure what kind of water.
227_Text=Sometimes people ask if my boat has a name.//I’ve never really thought about it.
238_Text=Sometimes people bring me gems and ask me to identify them.//I don’t know most of them, though. <NPCName>Rafael</> can tell you about all that. I just appreciate their beauty.
186_Text=Taking a break from farming?
270_Text=Thankfully, I bought some supplies for the boat the other day.//You know...flour, eggs, cookies...the usual.//<portrait=thinking>It'd be annoying to be outdoor when it storms like this.
159_Text=Thankfully, I have a small heater on my boat for snowy days like this.
271_Text=Thanks for coming to talk, but I’d rather be alone right now.
19_Text=That makes me feel stuck, you know?//<portrait=thinking>Like I’m in a cycle of endless adventures… One after another.//<portrait=happy>Now, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I’ll let you decide.
113_Text=That makes sense. I can tell from your outfit. It’s very…um…artistic.
202_Text=That was when <NPCName>Walter</> hired me to find his family’s lost heirloom.//<portrait=happy>I spent the year camping around the island to look for it… So much fun!
35_Text=That way, no one will ever sneak up on me unawares!//Could be fun, I think…
197_Text=That’s cool too.
117_Text=That’s true. All righty, then, good day to you.
248_Text=The Summer haze makes adventuring much more enjoyable. Everything feels heavy, still, and mysterious.
291_Text=The beach isn’t the place to find gems and precious stones.//Any gem that makes it into the water usually get beaten down by the waves.
94_Text=The boat isn’t really the best place to live in Winter. There’s a lot of wind, and it’s really hard to keep the heat going.
282_Text=The fish aren’t biting today.//I might have to eat something else for dinner.
83_Text=The forest is my preferred hangout spot… Not that I don’t like the sea.//<portrait=happy>There’s plenty of food growing around, especially this time of year. You get hungry? You can easily forage and light up a fire.
107_Text=The heat is exhausting.
38_Text=The island is full of mystery. I’ve been saying that for years! Glad to see someone else thinks so.
292_Text=The lake is a nice change of pace from the beach and the ocean.
71_Text=The mud can be annoying in Spring, but it’s still better than the cold Winter for treasure hunting.
258_Text=The ocean may rage with storms in Summer, but it can be just as bad in Winter.//And it’s a lot colder.
281_Text=The only real difference is I can take my home everywhere I go.//<portrait=normal>I like that.
120_Text=The only thing I know how to make with coconut milk is lodeh.//<portrait=normal>But I’m not in the mood for it. Hmm…
104_Text=The question is, will I find anything new today?
293_Text=The sand here is certainly less gritty.
181_Text=The water is calmer where I am, though.
164_Text=The weather couldn’t be better for reading.
158_Text=The weather couldn’t be better for reading… Or swimming.//<portrait=surprised>Or heck, fishing!
182_Text=The weather is great for a beach day today.
